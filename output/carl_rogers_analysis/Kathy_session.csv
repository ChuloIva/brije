Kathy,1,client,Kathy,I'm not quite sure where to begin.,1975
Kathy,1,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,2,client,Kathy,"But, uh, some of my concerns are, um, I've become very much aware since my husband was killed last December, um, my own feelings of aloneness.",1975
Kathy,2,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,3,client,Kathy,"And I don't think it’s directly related to his death because we had been separated for about four years before he was killed. And I, I became aware that, after he died especially, that he was really very important in my life. I was kind of using him as a shield against going out and having other relationships. And now he’s gone and I can't use that anymore. And I feel very, very frightened of new male relationships.",1975
Kathy,3,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So in some way his, his death, uh, really made you aware of the fear you have of, of new relationships, especially with men.",1975
Kathy,4,client,Kathy,"Right, right. Definitely, I didn't have him. I didn't have that to hide behind anymore. And, uh, I had a tremendous feeling of loss when he died because I did care for him. But, um, in going out with other men lately, I just have this feeling of, uh, it's very strange. I'm very uncomfortable.",1975
Kathy,4,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that, the feeling you have is something more than just the loss of him. It's a different feeling, a fee1ing of uneasy or scared or unsure.",1975
Kathy,5,client,Kathy,"Yes. For a long time I didn't feel like going out and that was fine. I was going through my loss of him, but that was all right. I didn’t push it or anything. But just recently I started going out and I've been aware for years of how lonely, I have been very, very lonely. I haven't been dating very much for the last four years, mostly just working and taking care of the kids. And um, I think I'm keeping myself in kind of a no-win situation where I'm really lonely. And yet it's kind of like I'm keeping myself there because I've got a guard around me, and I'd kind of like to break out of that.",1975
Kathy,5,therapist,Carl Rogers,It’s as though you're in some way sort of responsible for your loneliness.,1975
Kathy,6,client,Kathy,"Yes, I know that. I'm very… I am.",1975
Kathy,6,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And that's something you'd like to break out of that shell, or that safeguard that you've been hiding behind.",1975
Kathy,7,client,Kathy,Part of me does.,1975
Kathy,7,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Part of you does. Ok, ok.",1975
Kathy,8,client,Kathy,"Part of me says, “No way”.",1975
Kathy,8,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So it really is a very ambivalent, two-way thing. I suspect it's been pretty comfortable, um, behind that safeguard; it's more of risk if you break out. Is that part of it?",1975
Kathy,9,client,Kathy,"I, I can almost, well I was going to say I can almost go back to the point where I really built up that safeguard in me when my marriage was going bad. Over five years ago and I could feel myself, and I know I did, I withdrew and I’ve been withdrawn ever since. It's kind of like, “No more. I don't want any more hurt.” So…",1975
Kathy,9,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm, it's just too damn risky, taking the possibility of being hurt again. And you've withdrawn from that for a long time.",1975
Kathy,10,client,Kathy,"Uhm, hmm. See, and I've been aware of this for a long time too, but I never go beyond the awareness level.",1975
Kathy,10,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that the knowledge isn't new, it's the um, question of what you do about it.",1975
Kathy,11,client,Kathy,"That's right, that's right. How can one stay safe and still be open?",1975
Kathy,11,therapist,Carl Rogers,"The way you shake your head makes me feel, “I don't see any way.”",1975
Kathy,12,client,Kathy,"I don't, I really don’t. If I did, maybe I probably would have done it a long time ago, but I don't.",1975
Kathy,12,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Just seems kind of unbearable to, to be, open with a person and yet feel safe.",1975
Kathy,13,client,Kathy,"I, I think I'm a pretty open person to begin with. And uh, everything is fine in a relationship as long as the focus does not turn onto me.",1975
Kathy,13,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I see, I see. If you can keep the focus on the other person you're ok.",1975
Kathy,14,client,Kathy,"That's right. And the focus on me up to a certain level, but not in the romantic kind of a way. A friendship, I would value that.",1975
Kathy,14,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But love, you want to, keep that at arms length.",1975
Kathy,15,client,Kathy,"But you know, that's important though, because um, if a person doesn't want to really be your friend, how can you have them for a lover?",1975
Kathy,15,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,16,client,Kathy,No way.,1975
Kathy,16,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Not quite sure I get that. You mean friendship is a necessary first step, is that what you're saying, or…",1975
Kathy,17,client,Kathy,It is for me.,1975
Kathy,17,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,18,client,Kathy,We've gotten to the point where I won't go beyond.,1975
Kathy,18,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm, that's what I was sort of thinking. You've thought your way this far, but then where do you…",1975
Kathy,19,client,Kathy,I've laid the cards out and that's all I want to play.,1975
Kathy,19,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that, in this relationship it's like in your other relationships.",1975
Kathy,20,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,20,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It goes so far and then, “Let's stop. That's as far as I want to go.” If you go any further, there's a risk, isn't it?",1975
Kathy,21,client,Kathy,"Yes, it is.",1975
Kathy,21,therapist,Carl Rogers,And I think your eyes tell me you're feeling that risk right now.,1975
Kathy,22,client,Kathy,"So here I am. I feel like saying to myself, “Well you got this far. It's not so bad.” It's all right; I make the best out of it.",1975
Kathy,22,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's all right up to this point.,1975
Kathy,23,client,Kathy,"Yeah, right.",1975
Kathy,23,therapist,Carl Rogers,So let’s laugh it off.,1975
Kathy,24,client,Kathy,"Yeah, make a joke. Talk about something else.",1975
Kathy,24,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Could, very easy to run away from yourself.",1975
Kathy,25,client,Kathy,"See, but that's it. I made a bargain with myself. There's two parts: the part that understands and it’s all right, and the other part that's scared silly. But the part that understands isn’t going to force the part that's scared. When it’s safe enough, I'll be kind to myself.",1975
Kathy,25,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And let the scared part come out when, when you’re ready for it, when…",1975
Kathy,26,client,Kathy,"When the scared part feels ready. It’s as if part of me is in a cave away from the rest of the world. But it cert-, I certainly can't come out of that cave, unless I know that it’s all right, that there won't be a lot of pain to greet me. What's the sense in coming out? So it’s up to the best of me to make sure that there are nurturing people around me.",1975
Kathy,26,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And when you feel safe enough, either in this relationship or with other people, then you can let yourself come out of the cave and let the scared part of you emerge.",1975
Kathy,27,client,Kathy,"That's right. That's why, that's why I value the friendships with men and with other people. I don't care for the rest. Not to say that I don't need it, I do, but I need the friendship, and the safety and the security of that first. I, um, took a trip not too long ago and I met a man that I had known years and years ago, only very briefly. And I met him again I went out with him. And he was such a lovely person, such a kind person, and a very ... a very good person. Anyway, it was in the mountains and as I was driving home from his, um, his home, looking at the mountains, I, I had this feeling. It’s kind of funny, I haven't read the Carlos Castaneda books, but I know the concept of the third eye. And I was feeling as I was driving through those mountains that, “Now it’s all right for my third eye to come out, and to be able to perceive.” And I felt so good. But when I came back home, I've kind of busied myself with woodworking, and the house, and that kind of thing. And I'm kind of back in the same environment, in the same predicament. But I know that I, I consciously at times choose between focusing in on things and not.",1975
Kathy,27,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I'm, I'm really interested in that experience, when you were away from him, then there was just a little while, when it felt safe. And you could perceive…",1975
Kathy,28,client,Kathy,When I was driving.,1975
Kathy,28,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, when you were driving and you could perceive yourself and the whole situation, I guess.",1975
Kathy,29,client,Kathy,"I could perceive, it doesn’t have much to, it did have to do with him, but I could perceive myself, and my closed-offedness. And at that time I was open, and I had that perception of myself and that awareness that I had been closed. And that, when I was driving through that canyon I was feeling very open and now I could have my understanding, and it was a1l right.",1975
Kathy,29,therapist,Carl Rogers,You let yourself for that time come out of the cave.,1975
Kathy,30,client,Kathy,"Yeah, yes, it was great. And then he came to see me. He flew in to see me a couple of weeks ago. And um, I felt, see I was aware I had this memory of that opening up and so I felt more guarded.",1975
Kathy,30,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Ah, is that right.",1975
Kathy,31,client,Kathy,"But kind of slowly unpeeling layers, or slowing coming up.",1975
Kathy,31,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But somehow, having, having come out of the cave, you were afraid you might come out of the cave too easily.",1975
Kathy,32,client,Kathy,"Too, yeah that's right, that's right.",1975
Kathy,32,therapist,Carl Rogers,"“So, watch out, be careful”.",1975
Kathy,33,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,33,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You sound like a very tender, vulnerable part of you that lives in that cave.",1975
Kathy,34,client,Kathy,I think my most tender part.,1975
Kathy,34,therapist,Carl Rogers,Your most?,1975
Kathy,35,client,Kathy,My most tender part.,1975
Kathy,35,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Your most tender part. Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm. It's really a very precious part of you that you keep in the cave",1975
Kathy,36,client,Kathy,"I, for a long, long time, I’ve had the feeling of hopelessness of ever coming out. And do you know life is an existence without all of you…",1975
Kathy,36,therapist,Carl Rogers,Without?,1975
Kathy,37,client,Kathy,…all of you.,1975
Kathy,37,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, I see.",1975
Kathy,38,client,Kathy,Right.,1975
Kathy,38,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So, you, the hopelessness, I gather is because you know you're not living with all of you. Part of you you're keeping well hidden.",1975
Kathy,39,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,39,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Well guarded. And it isn't really living, unless you can live it with all of you.",1975
Kathy,40,client,Kathy,"That's right, it's just doing things, just doing things. The part that, you know, that I consciously avoid are the arts. The things that I love, music, theater, paintings, that kind of thing.",1975
Kathy,40,therapist,Carl Rogers,Those are the things that touch your feelings.,1975
Kathy,41,client,Kathy,I don’t get to the core.,1975
Kathy,41,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Ok, things that touch your feelings or touch the core of you, those you want to stay away from.",1975
Kathy,42,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,42,therapist,Carl Rogers,"They got, they get too close, too close to this very tender part of you.",1975
Kathy,43,client,Kathy,I’ve reached another stop.,1975
Kathy,43,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm, but you felt safe enough to let out a little bit more and now it’s come to another stop.",1975
Kathy,44,client,Kathy,"I have to give equal time to all of my dimensions. We just have, I just felt, you know, in touch with my vulnerability, but now I’m feeling angry.",1975
Kathy,44,therapist,Carl Rogers,Ok.,1975
Kathy,45,client,Kathy,"Like, “It’s none of your business…”",1975
Kathy,45,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,46,client,Kathy,…what I'm feeling.,1975
Kathy,46,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm, what am I doing getting that close to the vulnerable part of you? “Damn it, stay away.”",1975
Kathy,47,client,Kathy,"That’s right, that’s right. What do you want to do that for?",1975
Kathy,47,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,48,client,Kathy,You've got other things to do.,1975
Kathy,48,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So you’re putting up all kinds of guards against me, and striking out, “What the hell are you doing”, and, “getting so close to the vulnerable part of me, why don’t you go do something else”, hmm?",1975
Kathy,49,client,Kathy,That's the part that keeps me lonely.,1975
Kathy,49,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm. So that, that pushing away part, that kind of angry, “Get away from me” part, is what keeps you very lonely.",1975
Kathy,50,client,Kathy,"It's like I don't really trust that I can trust you to know that. I can tell this and that. You may feel a little something about it, but what then? You know, I mean you know, “It's a nice story, so, big deal, something else to do”.",1975
Kathy,50,therapist,Carl Rogers,"What I hear is that, is that you feel that I don’t really care, just a story…",1975
Kathy,51,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,51,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just something… but what if I do …,1975
Kathy,52,client,Kathy,You know…,1975
Kathy,52,therapist,Carl Rogers,But what if I do care.,1975
Kathy,53,client,Kathy,"I want to make a joke and say, ""Aw, go on."" You know, um, I'm a nurse and, a psychiatric nurse, worked in a psychiatric hospital last year. One of the big things there, the patients got a lot of points if they would talk in group. I mean everybody wants you to talk. You know, the good patient talks. And I thought, you know, anybody can talk. The reason why people don’t talk is not because they can’t talk, it’s because they don't know how people are going to respond. That's where it’s at. So I don’t think the patients were not being good patients. I don't think they were being bad patients because they weren't talking. I think that the staff should have a demerit for not responding. Ok, these patients talked, now how do you respond? Makes it a whole new ballgame.",1975
Kathy,53,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,54,client,Kathy,"And so now, I talked.",1975
Kathy,54,therapist,Carl Rogers,You've earned some points.,1975
Kathy,55,client,Kathy,"Yeah now I earned my points, that's true. But, um, I think that’s the fear of everyone. It’s not so much revealing themselves, but being cared about. That's my fear. That's my fears after I've revealed myself, “Who cares?”",1975
Kathy,55,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It's uh, when you've let out a tender part of yourself, then it’s damned important to know, “Does this other person care? Does it make any difference?”",1975
Kathy,56,client,Kathy,"My husband used to say he cared, but it was just words, it was words. He um, I think he cared as much as he could care but, he had so many conflicts inside of himself that he didn't even see me as a person. Didn't even see me. It's not that he didn't want to care. It's that he couldn't, he was too busy with himself. But I understand that. And I understand that with other people, too. But see I just can’t go around revealing myself all the time to people who are just too busy with themselves.",1975
Kathy,56,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm. You need a response, you need a caring, you need to make a difference to somebody.",1975
Kathy,57,client,Kathy,"That's it, not to someone who’ll say, ""Oh, well, Kathy, I really care,"" and then I don't see them for a couple of years. Or, ""I'll call you"" and then they never call. You know, when I first split up from my husband, I would go to these different functions, not with a date, but with friends, and meet a man and he'd say, ""I'll call you"". And for a while there I'd be sure that I wasn't home, because I couldn't stand to know if he didn't call. And that way I didn't know if he didn't call, so there was a possibility that he had called. But I wasn't home, so how could I know. So with that, that, that vulnerable I was really in touch with it.",1975
Kathy,57,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It makes so much difference to you to know whether the other person is going to really respond. “When they say they care, do they care?”",1975
Kathy,58,client,Kathy,"That's right, caring people, will call you, or drop by, “How's it going?”, that kind of thing.",1975
Kathy,58,therapist,Carl Rogers,And that's not enough?,1975
Kathy,59,client,Kathy,"No, it would be enough, if they would do that. That'd be just great, that would be just great. I don't think I really want that much from another person. The morsels are fine, but I'm not even getting the morsels.",1975
Kathy,59,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm, it isn't as though you want a whole meal, it's that…",1975
Kathy,60,client,Kathy,"Yeah, I mean I could work up to it all right. That's why I think with this friend it was nice. And may have gone back in but I felt myself, come alive a little bit. A little bit of magic had come into my life, and that was nice. And I'd rather not come out all at once and run back in. I'd rather come out bit-by- bit and stay out. But see the thing of it is that, and like we're talking now, a little bit, or I'm thinking about the focus of the relationship, it has to be this male-female kind of thing. And, um, I don't think that what I need to do is to come out and have love, and then, think about a male-female relationship. But I don't know how I can come out too much without a man .",1975
Kathy,60,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That's kind of a, contradiction, in a way. A dilemma, it's a dilemma. But you feel what you want first is a relationship with a person, only it helps if it’s a man.",1975
Kathy,61,client,Kathy,That's right. It must be a man. Or…,1975
Kathy,61,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It isn't just better if it's a man, it's a necessity.",1975
Kathy,62,client,Kathy,"It must be a man, that’s right, because that's where my fear is.",1975
Kathy,62,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that's where you fear is, a fear of a relationship with a man. And yet, you'd like to be able to really come out of the cave first, before it became a man- woman, sexual relationship, or anything like that. Is that what you're saying?",1975
Kathy,63,client,Kathy,"I'd like to have a caring relationship. And its kind of funny, it's like a little girl wanting a man to take her out of the cave, and, care about. I'll put it back on me, I feel like a little girl. Someone to care about me and to know that I'm comfortable and that I'm all right, and then ask for himself.",1975
Kathy,63,therapist,Carl Rogers,And then ask?,1975
Kathy,64,client,Kathy,"For himself, of the relationship.",1975
Kathy,64,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But first, you'd like to have a man come at least to the entrance of the cave and take the hand of you as a little girl and lead you gently out, caring for you. Then maybe, other kinds of things might happen.",1975
Kathy,65,client,Kathy,"The little girl is the non-sexual, being. That's right, “Don't use me sexually first. And then if you like it good enough, keep coming back.” That's what I don't want.",1975
Kathy,65,therapist,Carl Rogers,"The little girl, the little girl will grow up if you care enough, for her.",1975
Kathy,66,client,Kathy,"That's right, and can respond as a woman, if the other is there.",1975
Kathy,66,therapist,Carl Rogers,Can you tell him that? Could you tell him that?,1975
Kathy,67,client,Kathy,"I'm confused, do I tell one man that, or is that what I…",1975
Kathy,67,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I was thinking of this, this one man.",1975
Kathy,68,client,Kathy,"Oh, this individual.",1975
Kathy,68,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uhm, hmm.",1975
Kathy,69,client,Kathy,"Oh, I think I could tell him that, I know I could. But you know, I start putting him down. I know that's just, my sister told me, she said, “That's just because you're scared.” Because I told her the kind of man I would, I thought I would be comfortable with, and he is this kind of person. And then I start telling her all these bad things. And she said, ""Nobody would be perfect. You would do this with anyone, some."" But with this person I think I could.",1975
Kathy,69,therapist,Carl Rogers,Maybe you could let him know what you need.,1975
Kathy,70,client,Kathy,"I'd like to be able to carry that over. I suppose maybe, maybe I'm glossing that over or something, but I'd like to carry it over in my relationships with everyone. To get what I need from the relationship, and not focusing in on the other person. See, I think the way I am I'm the perfect nurse, the perf-, you know, anything for somebody else. And that's fine, focus in on them any time. But on myself, like I'm too scared to do that. Like that's a no-no. But I'd like to be able to do that, focus in on my own needs, first. But I feel kind of selfish when I look at it that way. I fee1 like a taker instead of a giver and that's got a negative, connotation.",1975
Kathy,70,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You're so much a nurse that when you even think of saying, “But I need this for myself.” that seems kind of wrong, selfish.",1975
Kathy,71,client,Kathy,"“Wait a minute, you're the nurse. What is this?”",1975
Kathy,71,therapist,Carl Rogers,“You're supposed to be caring for the other person.”,1975
Kathy,72,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,72,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But once in a while you realize, “I'd like to care for myself, first.”",1975
Kathy,73,client,Kathy,Seems awful.,1975
Kathy,73,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just to say that.,1975
Kathy,74,client,Kathy,"“You're so naughty, just thinking about it.”",1975
Kathy,74,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Just to say that, seems, “What a selfish person I am.”",1975
Kathy,75,client,Kathy,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,75,therapist,Carl Rogers,"“Terrible, awful.”",1975
Kathy,76,client,Kathy,"I feel wicked, but I enjoy it. I'm enjoying thinking about it.",1975
Kathy,76,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It's fun just to imagine, “I might want something for myself, first.”",1975
Kathy,77,client,Kathy,"It's really a lovely fantasy to be completely narcissist, completely self- centered, and into pleasure, and into comfort.",1975
Kathy,77,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just being good to yourself.,1975
Kathy,78,client,Kathy,"But in a way, you know, in a way I am being good to myself by keep that vulnerable part of me away until it's safe. Because not everybody would be good to you, not everybody would be kind. There are people who would use you up, and not bat an eyelash, and not even think about it.",1975
Kathy,78,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So you have a real respect for your, for your instinct for preserving yourself.",1975
Kathy,79,client,Kathy,That's right.,1975
Kathy,79,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You can't trust everyone, not everyone would care.",1975
Kathy,80,client,Kathy,"I was just smiling, I was thinking, but I care.",1975
Kathy,80,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And you say that with a smile, but that's pretty deep too isn't it?",1975
Kathy,81,client,Kathy,"Uhm, hmm. I do care.",1975
Kathy,81,therapist,Carl Rogers,“I care for myself”.,1975
Kathy,82,client,Kathy,"I like caring. I like it. I like caring for myself, and not giving away every part of my, just because some Tom, Dick, or Harry wants it.",1975
Kathy,82,therapist,Carl Rogers,"“I really prize myself, and I'm proud of that. I'm not going to just give myself away.”",1975
Kathy,83,client,Kathy,"That's right. It's nice to have that feeling of caring for myself, that's good. But you know since Dick died, I was thinking, I could die tomorrow. Any of us could, and, I'm missing, I want to have more. I don't want to just care for myself, I want to, I want to be able to care for myself and at the same time be able to take in life more. But I'm not doing, see I've closed it off, if I could figure out some way of doing that, then, you're smiling , so that'd be just great.",1975
Kathy,83,therapist,Carl Rogers,"To be able to care for yourself, and yet open yourself up to life, and somehow that also tied up with the realization that, “You know, death will come one day.” You'd like to live before you die.",1975
Kathy,84,client,Kathy,"That's right, I want, I saw a card one time that said, “Born, and then died.” And you open it up and it says, ""In between, he lived"" or something like that. That's what I would like for myself, a little life in between the born and the death, a little more life, and pleasure. See that's what I'm missing. Deep down inside is the, pleasure, experience of pleasure and joy, those kinds of experiences. I've been happy. I have fun. I do enjoy my children, but it's on a limited level.",1975
Kathy,84,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You don't really open yourself to joy. I guess fun, yes sure.",1975
Kathy,85,client,Kathy,"But joy is on a deeper level, you see, so… I want to say, ""But how've you been lately?"" .",1975
Kathy,85,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Well, “Lets change the subject.” .",1975
Kathy,86,client,Kathy,"Yes, “How's your wife, your house?” all that.",1975
Kathy,86,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Um, it'd be pretty nice to just, run away from some of this.",1975
Kathy,87,client,Kathy,"It would, yes.",1975
Kathy,87,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just talk.,1975
Kathy,88,client,Kathy,Well let’s just have a rest for a while.,1975
Kathy,88,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I'm impressed with the fact that when you need a rest, you really take it.",1975
Kathy,89,client,Kathy,"Oh, thank you. I was thinking my humor comes to the rescue, “Give me a breather.”",1975
Kathy,89,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's one of the ways in which you preserve yourself.,1975
Kathy,90,client,Kathy,"That's right; I had a dream one time. And I dreamed that I was on a sled with two other girls, and we were going down a snowy hill. And we were going too fast. And I told them to stop, they had to get off, otherwise they were going to crash into this train station at the bottom of the hill. And they wouldn't believe me. So I got off, and they went on. And I side-stepped in the snow all the way down the hill, but there were lots of trees where I was side stepping, and I was hanging onto the trees, one by one as I went down. And when I got to the bottom of the hill, the sled had crashed, or something. And then I thought to myself, “That means, that has to do with me. Part of me would go too fast, and…”",1975
Kathy,90,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And, and this morning has been an example of the fact that you're not going to go so fast that you crash. You're going to go at your own pace if its step-by-step down the hill, oh, that's the pace you have.",1975
Kathy,91,client,Kathy,That must be it.,1975
Kathy,91,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Maybe that's a good stopping point. END Rogers’ Post-Session Commentary I found it fascinating, the way in which this client very slowly lowers her defenses. I think those defenses could be broken through, but that in my estimation would not be as helpful as letting her proceed at her own pace. I think the client learns more that way. We did progress in the interview. We went from her perception of loneliness as her problem, to her fear of her relationships with men, to her feelings about letting the tender, vulnerable part of herself come out of a cave, to the recognition of the little girl in her that wants to be tenderly let out. She then began to get to the recognition of the deep, of the pain that is deep inside of her. That is unspeakable, almost unbearable. We saw her partially experience that pain, in spots, and then draw back. Then finally we saw the feelings that she has, that perhaps at bottom she is completely unlovable, one of the commonest feelings that people have. I thought that the dream at the end was almost a perfect description of the hour. She went deeper into herself, step-by-step, by slow degrees, cautiously and guardedly because she didn’t want to crash into that pain. And she took resting times between the steps. So I thought that described the whole progress of the hour. I feel that it was a working interview, not highly dramatic, and much of therapy is work, and this was a good example of it. I felt present to her. I felt a companion in her exploration. If I were to continue to see her I think that she would gradua1ly move toward experiencing that care of herself of which she is quite frightened. I like the way we got into metaphors. Clients can say more in metaphors then they can say, than they dare to say openly. And I like the way I responded to the metaphors. I liked the way she was able to express her anger toward me whenever she felt it, whenever she felt that she was close to a dangerous part of her experiencing a painful part of her experiencing and that was easy for me to accept that anger. I felt good about this as a first interview.",1975
Kathy,1,client,Kathy,Okay.,1975
Kathy,1,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I've heard a few things about you, all good things, and I've also heard that you have leukemia but that you're in a state of remission, and that’s all I know about you . . . so from there on ...",1975
Kathy,2,client,Kathy,Okay.,1975
Kathy,2,therapist,Carl Rogers,Whatever we do is up to us. What things do you feel you want to talk about today?,1975
Kathy,3,client,Kathy,"I don't know. I was sitting in the room and waiting, before, and I was thinking about when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I remember reading a book, I believe. And I can't recall the name, by Jung, I think it was. I recalled that when I was reading it, at that time, I used to go down in the basement of my home and um, turn off all the lights. And in a way, that was kind of closing the outside world out and concentrating on what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. And at 7 years old I was into that, and today I'm in the same position . . . um, really at this, you know, trying to find out what I want to do, what I want to be. And um, I've learned a lot of things. I've learned a lot of things since I found out that I have leukemia which is about a year ago this June . . . and I've learned an awful lot of things.",1975
Kathy,3,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I'll bet. And you're going through a stage if I understand is a little bit like what it was at seven, sort of shutting out the world or shutting yourself into a space where you're trying to figure out what it is that you want or who you are?",1975
Kathy,4,client,Kathy,"I think that I've listened for so long to other people about who I was and I remember in 2nd grade I was a potential credit to my race. That was one of the . . . I used to wonder why I couldn't be a credit to somebody else's race also. I think I was really conditioned to be something. To be some kind of a symbol, or whatever, and not really being a person, you know, I kind of missed out on my childhood to an extent. I don't really regret it. I don't think I regret it anyway, but I've really been through a lot of changes. And I think that now, after finding out I had leukemia and after dealing with the leukemia in the way I did, it's just really incredible, you see. It was last June when I found out, and um, I proceeded to get everything in order because I was told that I had less than a year to live. And uh, that was the trip. That was a trip.",1975
Kathy,4,therapist,Carl Rogers,"A trip into a fairly dark place, I suppose.",1975
Kathy,5,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah. For sure. For sure. On one hand I accepted the death. I, you know, at my young age I think I've lived long and a great deal. But that was the start of some things that really has had an effect on me today. I'm much happier than I've ever been . . . today. I'm much happier. But there's a lot of hurt too. There's an awful lot of hurt and I think I'm just beginning to realize that. Um, because you know, in being a credit to your race, in being an outstanding student, an outstanding scholar, an outstanding football player, whatever; it leaves you little room to be . . .",1975
Kathy,5,therapist,Carl Rogers,You've been meeting other people's expectations of you and it seems that that's what you should do now. I guess you're really questioning that very much.,1975
Kathy,6,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah. Tremendously. And like you get into . . . the fun thing about it is that I'm finding out that some of the things that I think inside of me are okay. And like that isn't . . . you know, I feel okay, and I'm in a process of becoming okay. But like I haven't worked it out. Hurt is a hard thing to deal with. And like conditioning yourself to die is another thing, you know, you see, I didn't let my family in on that until March of this year. So it was some months before I . . .",1975
Kathy,6,therapist,Carl Rogers,You carried that within you.,1975
Kathy,7,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah. But I proceeded very meticulously to carry out a plan, where my children would live in an area that I wanted them to live. And that, I was trying to control something after I died. Only when I went back this year in March to celebrate my children's birthday, and I had four weeks, incidentally, to live at that time; I was told on March 15 that I had four weeks to live. And it was really incredible because like, for the first time, I saw all my relatives and my friends. And they were coming in and they were very loving, very loving people, and very kind, you see. Um, but at the same time, they were all throwing flowers on my grave. And I don't think they knew that. And as a result, I got worse and I got worse, and um, I took a friend back. You see, I'd lived out here in California. um, after I found out that I had leukemia, I proceeded to develop a plan to move my family out here. And we moved out in approximately November after several trips out in the area. The trips were basically to find a doctor and also find in a way some kind of a hope. You see, I have this conditioned thing about being a fighter. So, on one hand I accept that, and on the other hand I was trying to do all I damned well could to live.",1975
Kathy,7,therapist,Carl Rogers,"If it's going to be death, okay, you'll take it. But you're not going to take it unnecessarily.",1975
Kathy,8,client,Kathy,No. Not at all.,1975
Kathy,9,client,Kathy,"You know, the thing that uh, you know, after I was sitting in there and I was thinking . . . I had really conditioned myself to, to really get ready and find the nearest cross and crawl up on that, and I've been doing that since I was seven years old, and I'm not sure why.",1975
Kathy,9,therapist,Carl Rogers,"To really crucify yourself, is that what you're saying? Or to be a martyr? I'm not really sure . . .",1975
Kathy,10,client,Kathy,"Oh, I'm not really sure. But I think the activities I was involved in, in terms of trans-racial communication, working with groups, and helping people I would hope very similar to what people like yourself did. Um, always being available for everybody, all the time. I think that's being a martyr or something. Yeah.",1975
Kathy,10,therapist,Carl Rogers,Putting the other person first.,1975
Kathy,11,client,Kathy,"For sure. Yeah. Instead of saying, ""Hey, there's some time for me."" Because you see, I worked so hard and so long that it was just really, really difficult for me to get used to, you know, being sick, not working' and not being in control because I definitely was not in control. And there were a lot of things that I did that I am not really very pleased about. But you know, after thinking about it for just a little while, or whatever, one of the things I miss you know, I guess maybe from not telling people or whatever, about I was ill . . . but uh, after I told them, some months later, when I had four weeks to live, I didn’t find anybody that allowed me to be desperate, that could understand some of the things that I didn't want to do. And that brought on another guilt trip. And so now I'm in the process of kind of washing all that stuff out.",1975
Kathy,11,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. Is that part of the hurt? You referred earlier to hurt and I didn't quite understand that. I can understand the feeling of desperateness and also I can understand how hard it would be to have no one really understand that feeling in you.",1975
Kathy,12,client,Kathy,"I've lost my father-in-law, which was a terrible loss to me, and it was a loss that I never could talk to my wife or anybody else about. And I gave a lot to that family, you know, for five or, I don't know, seven years I guess. And when I went back, there were just some things that happened that they showed me there wasn't, there wasn't very much of a connection. There wasn't very much of a connection between, between all of that love and whatever that I put in, and then all of a sudden you know, I became just another uh, you know, I became just another black person. I became just another nigger. You know, and I think it's important to understand that my wife is you know, is white, German Irish. And I think that's a part of that whole thing. Um, when we first married, you know, my father-in-law, we just fought tooth and nail, but then after that we loved each other . . . for about six long, good, hard years. And basically, he was my only connection and when he died . . . I found that there was no support. There was absolutely no support.",1975
Kathy,12,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And I, I imagine . . . or perhaps I catch a little bit of resentment, that you really poured a lot of love and caring into that family and had gotten some back from him, but after his death, none of it paid off for you in any way.",1975
Kathy,13,client,Kathy,"Right. For sure. Yeah, I think that, you know, what I wanted, what I wanted more than anything else, was just to you know, I guess, was love. I guess it was that mutualness, you know, what I felt for each of them. You know, I thought that was not only my responsibility, but you know, it was very natural for me to care about people that were very close to my wife at that time.",1975
Kathy,13,therapist,Carl Rogers,So it hurt not to get that love back. It wasn't mutual.,1975
Kathy,14,client,Kathy,Oh yeah. For sure it did.,1975
Kathy,15,client,Kathy,"And there were various things that happened in terms of things that were happening back east . . . that people were wondering why I had left, you know, a good position and all that kind of garbage. And uh, because, see, I hadn't told anybody that I had leukemia. And uh, one thing led to another. And there were stories that needed, I think to um, I think every story, every situation needs to have two sides. And there was only one side and I was, I was hurt because I didn't have my chance.",1975
Kathy,15,therapist,Carl Rogers,You never were heard.,1975
Kathy,16,client,Kathy,"Never. And, but at the same time, like, in a way, in a way, I used to feel that I put myself in that position. Because no one knew what was happening inside of me, you see. Because I had to take care of myself. And I had to be better than everybody else. Because I was always told that. You can, in a majority society I had to be 100, 200 percent better than my white counterpart or my brown counterpart, or whatever. I had to do that, because that's what it took to survive .",1975
Kathy,16,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. And in striving for that, one reason you really weren't heard was that you didn't dare express the person you were, the sick person you were at that time.",1975
Kathy,17,client,Kathy,"Oh, no. Not at - I really, I really had a fear of that. You know? I really, I guess, didn't trust some things that were happening, um, gee, at a whole global level, you know. But to, then to entrust that kind of information to other people. I was very uneasy about that. Very uneasy about that. And I did a lot of things that I didn't, didn't really want to do because I was very desperate. Um, I gave up my, my job and came out here, and I did consultant work and so forth, but I had to use a great deal of money for diagnosticians or whatever and, and, and all kinds of little gimmicks to keep me alive. And consequently I had to borrow money. And when I borrowed that money, I didn't borrow it in a way that would say to you like, ""Hey, uh, Ted or whatever, I need, you know X amount of dollars, you know, and like . . . 'cause I've got, I have leukemia,"" and so forth. I'm scared to death to say that, you know? You know, I needed some money because of uh, I think I must have invented about ten stories, you know. And I think about it and you know, like, I felt real bad about that, you know. And uh, because like I had developed a professional uh, attitude I think, about myself, or at least a kind of . . . I had a lot of respect from a lot of people. And you know, I really did have that . . . I don’t know if that was love or caring or whatever, but it was respect. When I got involved with money, the situation with money, I had to borrow money and I really couldn't tell. And in a way, you know, I really wanted to tell, but I hadn't even told my wife and my family. And I said, okay, well one thing, you know, and I'm gonna, I'm going to be okay, and this money is going to be here, and everything else like that and I think that's a part of, uh, me that I really, I'm not really sure, that ah, you know, is really acceptable you know, because I have to be perfect.",1975
Kathy,17,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. Yeah. So, it's not acceptable even to you to do some of the things you did, and also I gather to live behind that facade of falsehood for quite awhile . . . not telling anybody what the score was.",1975
Kathy,18,client,Kathy,Oh yeah. For sure. Very true. I . . .,1975
Kathy,19,client,Kathy,"That was very difficult. The most difficult part, I think, of I think it was the most difficult part of my illness. It was that, ""Hey, I couldn't have cancer,"" you know. That's like having V.D. and three kinds of V.D. at the same time. You know, how do you tell someone, ""I have leukemia . . . I have less than a year to live, or whatever . . . and I need some money."" You know, it's like when people you know, look at a drinking glass or whatever, and you know, after you told them you have cancer . . . and they make kind of a . . . shy away from your drinking glasses.",1975
Kathy,19,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm. How could you possibly let anybody know where you were physically?",1975
Kathy,20,client,Kathy,"I really don't know. I really, you know, I've really tried to debate this thing in myself for a long time, and I really, I really don't know how I could have done anything any other way, because, you see, it was my character to not, I never . . . I'm always there to help other people. I wasn't there for . . . to say, ""Hey, you know, I need some nourishment right now, whatever, you know.""",1975
Kathy,20,therapist,Carl Rogers,You've just had no experience in being the needy person that needed help and needed . . .,1975
Kathy,21,client,Kathy,"Absolutely. Even when I needed money or whatever, I didn't need money because of my health. It was because of maybe bad business experience or an investment, or something or other . . . and like, for the people who trusted that kind of information or whatever . . . like I, you know, well, I'm going to deal with that. I'm going to deal with that. But that's not in my character, it's never been in my character. I had to keep that image. I had to keep the image. And uh, it cost me my family, a couple children, you know. I guess that was the most important thing that it cost me. I think the other things are really not that important. But, but what it did do, what the leukemia did do . . . it helped me to, to understand that I'm just an ordinary human being like everybody else. You know, and sometimes you know, like, everybody has problems, and so forth, but at the same time it was like, it was my character to do that. You know, I wouldn't tell them. No. For what?",1975
Kathy,21,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But it sounds as though the leukemia helped you to really destroy the notion of you as the ""image.""",1975
Kathy,22,client,Kathy,"I think, I think it did. I think it did. Finally, at the end it did. I use the end . . . the four weeks when I was told I had four weeks to live that was the end, at the end of the leukemia. Even though I'm in remission now, I don't plan to, I don't . . . you see, I haven't told you that I went to, I went for the tests and gave enormous amounts of blood. I don't know where they were sending that blood or what they were doing with it. I gave an extraordinary amount, but nothing, nothing was coming of that. But you know, one of the things I did know that if I went to the hospital, if I did what the doctors said, I'd probably die. And it's almost like, you know, when you first become an agnostic in school, or whatever, you know, you go through . . . like I went through all this religious training, whatever. . . and I said, ""I don't think that there's a God."" Or, ""that isn't really important, or whatever."" But then at the same time, I hold back, you know. And every now and then I give an occasional prayer just in case.",1975
Kathy,22,therapist,Carl Rogers,Play it safe.,1975
Kathy,23,client,Kathy,"For sure. I think that's what I was also doing in terms of the leukemia. I really did. I had . . . the logical end to leukemia that my uncle and cousin had had before me was to die. Was to die. And now I think I know some things about that, though, that you don't have to die. Because it wasn't until I saw everybody throwing leaves and things on my grave that I really understood that I had the power to do that, and that, by lying for money, was probably worse for me than . . . than the leukemia, I think. I don’t know if that makes any sense . . .",1975
Kathy,23,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah. It does.,1975
Kathy,24,client,Kathy,Now I said it.,1975
Kathy,24,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm. Somehow, what I get out of it is that being kind of false to yourself really was more of a burden to you, causes you more concern, than the fact that you had leukemia.",1975
Kathy,25,client,Kathy,"Oh, for sure. For sure.",1975
Kathy,26,client,Kathy,"The other thing was that I was about ready to leave my children, you know, very young, beautiful children . . . children that I'd brought into the world to do the same kind of, kind of thing that I was doing, you know . . . to take the world on their back and change things. You know, and now that helped me now with my kids in the sense of I don't think I want to raise my children like that.",1975
Kathy,26,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. You don't want them to carry the kind of burden and image that you carried.",1975
Kathy,27,client,Kathy,"No. Not at all. Not because they're part Indian. Not because they're part black. Or not because they're third world or whatever. They don't have to carry that burden of trying to change and always being the recipient of certain policies and things like that and always being controlled. And I never really, it made me feel apart . . . because I don't know if my second grade teacher thought they were doing me a favor by telling me I was a credit to my race, but then . . . they certainly did, and I didn't feel good about it then. That's a start.",1975
Kathy,28,client,Kathy,"And I remember talking to a person when I came down. I'd just discovered I was in remission, and I was hobbling on a cane, and so forth, and God, the first thing I did down here was to take a motorcycle ride. Now, for me, that was radical. For me, that was extremely radical, but it was fun you know, and it was one of the first fun things that I did. Since I was ill, you know, because on top of having the leukemia I was fighting a divorce and having my property ripped away from me, you know, and having married into a family, and a family that was a different race than I was, and I learned later, as my wife told me that she didn't know that a whole community wanted to divorce. Like they were married. And I was hurt by that too. You know, how very good, Christian, upstanding people can make some pretty serious judgments without knowing you know, the whole story.",1975
Kathy,28,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And I catch a note of bitterness there. A feeling that they really make judgments without, without knowing the picture.",1975
Kathy,29,client,Kathy,"For sure. For sure. Well, the thing that was incredible was that I didn't . . . forgot about, I guess is that to understand, that you know, . . . I forgot for maybe a couple of years - Now, I'm going to oversimplify this next thing . . . but I forgot that I was black, in that family, in that community, or whatever, you see. And then I quickly learned that I . . .",1975
Kathy,29,therapist,Carl Rogers,And then you were reminded all over again.,1975
Kathy,30,client,Kathy,"Oh, for sure. For sure. And I think that also caused a lot of bitterness or whatever. And that kind of stuff I want to get out of me. You know, I can't deal with that . . . someone else's trip on me. Because I really don't hate anybody for that or whatever. A lot of the things I've brought on myself. But at the same time, I think I really do have the right at that time to have been desperate.",1975
Kathy,30,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,31,client,Kathy,And I didn't really understand that.,1975
Kathy,32,client,Kathy,"It was just, you know, hey it was so bad, it got so bad . . . this whole trip of leukemia . . . and lying and things like that or whatever, that I don't know. I thought, ""Well, if I can just get ahead a little bit, and make enough money to pay off all those people or whatever, or, and even in my will and with my insurance"" You know, I made sure that all of the people were going to be paid or whatever but, you know. I still wasn't, it still wasn't acceptable to me for some reason . . . I didn't want to go out owing anybody or whatever, because that wasn't, wouldn't be the American thing to do, I guess at that time.",1975
Kathy,32,therapist,Carl Rogers,That wouldn't be living up to the standards you've set for yourself and other people have set for you.,1975
Kathy,33,client,Kathy,"Oh. Yeah. For sure. And like, I'm a little tired of those standards. I'm really a little tired of those standards. And I basically think that the kind of things that um, . . . me and what I'm into, and what turns me on . . . is good for me. And I don't really know why I went into remission. You know, I have some feelings about that . . . you know, personal, religious, whatever. But I think a great part of that had something to do with deciding that I wanted to live.",1975
Kathy,33,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. Perhaps, sounds as though you're saying several things here, that perhaps deciding you wanted to live made a real difference. And also deciding that what you were experiencing as your needs and your wants and so on, really had some validity.",1975
Kathy,34,client,Kathy,Yeah. It's really good to hear you say that. Because I really feel that. Because what I did I think was . . . -,1975
Kathy,37,client,Kathy,"My phone bill had to be about $1,500 a month you know, because I was so worried about the children, you know.",1975
Kathy,37,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. So that was a big, heavy burden too, then huh?",1975
Kathy,38,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, it really was pretty heavy. It was pretty heavy. End of Part 1",1975
Kathy,38,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Life has been a very fluctuating up and down, kind of",1975
Kathy,39,client,Kathy,"For sure. But the leukemia took me away from Michigan, which I have . . . oh, bless somebody for that. And if you know, I only live a couple of more months, or whatever, it's a lot better than living under uh, constant stress you know of worrying about not being accepted, or not being accepted.",1975
Kathy,39,therapist,Carl Rogers,But that's one good thing that the leukemia did for you.,1975
Kathy,40,client,Kathy,"Yeah. It really was. Because I got a divorce out of it. My goodness, I got to California. Um, and I really mean that.",1975
Kathy,41,client,Kathy,"But even when I say it, you know, there's . . . it was a rough, scratchy, scratchy road . . . and you know, it's extremely difficult for me to talk about it now. It really is .",1975
Kathy,42,client,Kathy,"In getting all those bad things out, I'm not sure in terms of how to deal yet, or whatever. And I'm really not sure. But there are some you know, some things you know, like, I've really got to come to grips with it. ""Well, finally,"" you know. Because they're still, you know, when I talk to my wife from 3,000 miles away and she tells me about what her mother thinks and all sorts of other things, or whatever, I get sick. It happened yeah . . . it happened the other day. She called and everything was really great and then she'd begin to talk about a lot of other people, and what their attitudes and what their opinions was. That night I got very little sleep and was ready to go back to the hospital and was ready to have leukemia too. I was ready. You know?",1975
Kathy,42,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So you feel as though in some sense you prepare the readiness for the illness, or you, are taking in something from outside; it makes you ready to have it.",1975
Kathy,43,client,Kathy,"It seems like it. You know, I didn't believe that. I didn't believe that statement that you just made, some time ago, but I believe it now. I believe it.",1975
Kathy,44,client,Kathy,"You know, I recall when I went back, and, and, and um, for the first time, my parents had learned that I had leukemia. You know, what do you say to your mother? What do you say to your father? I remember I got a phone call. And I was staying at my wife's house where we were going, keep in mind now, we were going through a divorce, the whole bit, and were, uh celebrating my children's birthday at the same time. My mother calls. ""We're coming over."" Nobody at the house. All of a sudden I lose my . . . my vision goes. You know, that was one of the symptoms of leukemia. And uh, and, it scare-, it scared the hell out of me like I really wanted to run. But I couldn't run, I couldn't see. And um, it was only when I got back to California that I tried to put that together, you know of what happened when in terms of you know, the paralysis that I had in terms of my legs. It's incredible, it really seemed like somehow, somehow I've got control of that, in some way but I mean I'm not really sure. But I'm convinced that I have control. But I'm not sure how. You know.",1975
Kathy,44,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I gather you feel that where before these things happened to you because of what happened to you from the outside, now you are beginning to feel control over it yourself . . . from the inside. Is that, is that part of what you're saying?",1975
Kathy,45,client,Kathy,I think that's what I'm saying.,1975
Kathy,46,client,Kathy,"When I'm positive and when I’m doing things that I enjoy, I don't have symptoms anymore. I don't have symptoms. And I don't you know, like, when I came down here, the doctors wanted me to have transfusions and things like that, you know, and I remember one doctor saying to me, ""I don't know really who's got you into playing this tennis and all that, or whatever, but you really need to come in here and have a transfusion."" I said, ""For what? I'm doing okay."" ""To be on the safe side."" You know? That's . . . well, I won't say what that is. But, you know, like, to some extent though, that confirms some things to me about not trusting doctors to take care of myself. I'm talking about the leukemia. I'm certainly not trying to indict all doctors or the medical profession by what happened to me, you know, I think, I hope, in some way that other people who have life-threatening illnesses can deal with it because I think I have, and I do have that control. And like, since I was 7, to some extent, when I went down in that basement and turned that light off, or whatever, and I shut the outside world off . . . or whatever, somehow I've lost that . . . because somehow in the process of becoming educated and socialized, and whatever, I let other people control what I wanted and what I wanted to do. And I really . . . I did. That was a . . . Jesus, that was a, yeah, well, okay.",1975
Kathy,46,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That has a lot of meaning to me, and I want to make sure I'm getting it straight. Down in that basement as a 7-year old with the lights out . . . you were really finding yourself and, I gather, trusting yourself. And then life was, said to you, ""No, no, don't do that. We have the standards for you. Live up to our expectations. You've got to be the image. You've got to be just right. And everything."" And now you are gradually recapturing what you felt as a 7-year old.",1975
Kathy,47,client,Kathy,"I believe that to be true. Because even though that you know, the responsibility, you know, it was like something inside of me could touch something that wasn't seen . . . when I was seven. And I can't remember what the book was that Young wrote, or whatever. But it had an extraordinary effect on me, this seven- year-old, you know? You know, I started writing poetry. My first poem. But I guess I did lose it. I did lose it. Like I still had it, but all this garbage about me being . . .",1975
Kathy,47,therapist,Carl Rogers,It was well buried?,1975
Kathy,48,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Yeah. And then other people were shaping me up by saying, well, you know, ""You're really good if you do it this way, or whatever.""",1975
Kathy,48,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""You're a credit to your race.""",1975
Kathy,49,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah. ""You're extraordinary. You're a credit to your race."" You know, and, I don't know. Maybe they meant very well, or whatever, but it didn't do the job. It didn't do the job, you know, because in a way, by accepting that kind of praise, and their kind of . . . buying into their kind of system, or whatever, like, I gave up something that I knew already at 7 years old.",1975
Kathy,49,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And that something, as I get it, is you were giving up something of yourself.",1975
Kathy,50,client,Kathy,"Yeah. I've . . . sounds good. Yeah, I did. I did.",1975
Kathy,51,client,Kathy,"You know, maybe I'd have been better off if I'd just gone on and lived my life rather than try to live other people's lives or whatever, you know. But I gave up being happy myself. You know, I didn't expect you know, I guess I didn't expect myself to be happy, or to really maybe deserve happiness, or something.",1975
Kathy,51,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sounds like you wanted so much to help people, that ah helping yourself didn't fit into that picture at all.",1975
Kathy,52,client,Kathy,"Not at all. Not at all. There was enough to do without worrying about your own little problems and things like that at that time, so I said to myself then, you know? Oh, yeah. A lot of things are racing through my mind as we talk and, but there are certain things that go through this whole thing that I pick out in terms of when I was seven, and those are just really important times for me, you know. They were important times in terms of when I was alone, and when I was sure, and when I felt good and I felt a part of the you know, the stars, the universe. I really did feel that. You know, I remember I used to go out when I was 7, 8, 9 years old . . . three or four o'clock in the morning, look up in that beautiful sky and see those stars or whatever, and I'd say, ""That's mine over there and I'm going to be there."" And I felt good. I felt I don't know, in a sense integrated, more integrated than after . . . and as I continued to do this and fill out the forms for a scholarship, or things like that, I lost it. I really lost it.",1975
Kathy,52,therapist,Carl Rogers,"At seven, you were really a part of the universe and you knew it.",1975
Kathy,53,client,Kathy,"That's what I thought. But you know, what does a 7 year old know, you know, I don't know.",1975
Kathy,54,client,Kathy,"I think I did. Yes, I knew it. I knew it because I knew, because I was always drawn to the stars, you know. It wasn't anything like my parents would wake me up in the middle of the night, or whatever, I woke up; I don't know why.",1975
Kathy,54,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It was something that you wanted to do. It was something you had a view. Not because somebody else said, ""Hey you should be interested in the stars or something like that.""",1975
Kathy,55,client,Kathy,"For sure. For sure. And I was, I think at that time I was really the best person that I could be. And you know, I guess, for some reason, I don't want to heap it on everybody else you know, but I was just taught, conditioned or something that . . . to not trust that anymore. To . . . you know. It's like those things when you're young you hold onto or whatever.",1975
Kathy,55,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""But then, that's just childish. That's just . . . """,1975
Kathy,56,client,Kathy,Right. Right. Yeah.,1975
Kathy,56,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""Don't trust that stuff."" ""They're telling you what's right.""",1975
Kathy,57,client,Kathy,"Yeah, yeah. I've really suppressed . . . I guess a hell of a lot of anger. 'Cause you know, when you said that, you know, I felt you know, like . . . you know, I think of all kind of words now.",1975
Kathy,58,client,Kathy,"Really for sure. You’re a minority . . . and in terms of a minority within a minority within a minority. Like mother's Osage. She's part Indian, her family . . . that history. Father a descendant of black slaves. You know? And then being picked out, you know? Because that's what it was, you know, 'cause I knew what was happening to other people in the class, whether they were white or black or whatever. But it was . . . you know, but I always really understood that I had to be 200 percent better than everybody else so I'd achieve. I almost killed myself playing football because I wanted to be the littlest superstar, whatever that means. It's crazy things. You know, it was that competitiveness, or whatever, you know. And it was that I wouldn't have anything if I didn't compete and if I didn't do it like, you know, somebody else told me to do. I guess.",1975
Kathy,58,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So those standards and what they did to you really, really dominated your life, if I get it right.",1975
Kathy,59,client,Kathy,"I think so. I really think so. I, I uh, my reference point became . . . and I guess I bought into that. You know, I really bought into that. And I really, it really seems foreign to me now. It seems as foreign, I think, as leukemia, you know. You know I've . . . it really does, you know.",1975
Kathy,59,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. One way of putting it is I feel you are saying, ""Damn it, that seven year old was more right than all that's gone on in between.""",1975
Kathy,60,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Yeah. And maybe trying to get back to that, and whatever, and now and uh, you know, I just wonder how, how that person at 7 would have been dealing with the leukemia and all those other problems now. It would have been interesting, I think. Probably would've handled it much better. Feel some kind of release. I don't know.",1975
Kathy,61,client,Kathy,"I told a lot of people you know, about um, about me. You know, and something that came out you know, and that other part of me may be . . . I'm really wondering about trusting too, right now. You know 'cause I've trusted a lot of other people, too.",1975
Kathy,61,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And so you're wondering, ""Yeah, but can I trust him?""",1975
Kathy,62,client,Kathy,Hmm. Well . . .,1975
Kathy,62,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Maybe part of that reason is you feel, ""My God, I've told him a lot. I've trusted him. Have I trusted him too much?""",1975
Kathy,63,client,Kathy,"Sure. Well, I guess I'm just going to have to deal with it in terms of do I trust myself to tell you. You know, but I do have that, you know. I have that history.",1975
Kathy,64,client,Kathy,"You know, . . . but I've really been you know, like a lot of other people, like a lot of other people, you know, or whatever. But I've learned so many things from this, this whole thing, or whatever, you know. And even just sitting here and talking with you, whether you're Carl Rogers or Jesus Christ or whatever, you know . . .",1975
Kathy,64,therapist,Carl Rogers,Or Joe Doakes.,1975
Kathy,65,client,Kathy,"Or whomever, you know, it's a, still it's a very difficult thing for me to . . .",1975
Kathy,65,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah. Yeah.,1975
Kathy,66,client,Kathy,"And I don't know if I just haven't allowed myself to be open, you know, and to be needy or whatever. But is that junk? That ""credit to . . ."" You know, that really makes me mad. That really made me mad. I mean, I keep, in mind as I'm talking, it keeps coming back to me, you know. ""Credit to my race, to my race."" I remember that teacher so well, with big boobs, and she put my head right in them and said I was a credit to her race. And you know, that . . . oh, that burned me up.",1975
Kathy,66,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So as you get deeper into that feeling it isn't just that you, earlier, you said you wondered if it was wise of her to do that. Now you know, ""Damn it, I'm really angry at her for doing that to me.""",1975
Kathy,67,client,Kathy,Yeah. And I'm even more angrier when I see it happening all the time. And I don't want it to happen to my kids. And I didn't really want my kids to be a credit to their race. You know? And I know that now. Getting militant.,1975
Kathy,67,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Our time's about up and I don't know if there’s more you want to say now for today, okay. Or if not, we can call it quits for today.",1975
Kathy,68,client,Kathy,Well I'd like to be able to tell you something.,1975
Kathy,68,therapist,Carl Rogers,All right.,1975
Kathy,69,client,Kathy,"That is going to make me feel good. That is going to continue to have me feel positive about myself and to grow and to be nourished or whatever, but I'm really not sure what to say. You know, but I really want to do that, so that I can continue to live, you know. That's important to me, and so um, but it's just not coming. But I think I really want to say that and be comfortable in saying, you know, ""I got raked over the coals and I resent it and I'm mad and I'm angry and I need to get that to be angry You know.",1975
Kathy,69,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""Okay. I was really screwed by a lot of people, and I have reason to be angry, and I am angry, and I need to say that."" I can hear the anger in there.",1975
Kathy,70,client,Kathy,"Yeah. But you know how I haven't said it yet, though, you know. I really haven't. You know, I think it um, I think it's just a part of being civilized maybe.",1975
Kathy,70,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mhm, hmm. You're talking about it in a very civilized fashion. Living up to those standards.",1975
Kathy,71,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Which I'd like to just go back and kick some butts, I think. Well, enough of the militancy.",1975
Kathy,71,therapist,Carl Rogers,Okay? Shall we call it quits for today?,1975
Kathy,72,client,Kathy,Yeah. I think so.,1975
Kathy,72,therapist,Carl Rogers,Alright good. See you tomorrow.,1975
Kathy,1,therapist,Carl Rogers,O.K. Where do you want to start this morning?,1975
Kathy,2,client,Kathy,"Uh, I don't know. I wa ... I was thinking that when we ... when we talked earlier about the, the anger ... I've been thinking a great deal about that.",1975
Kathy,2,therapist,Carl Rogers,I've thought a lot about what you had to say about that.,1975
Kathy,3,client,Kathy,"Right, you know, and I'm not sure that, uh, that I really don't want to be angry, you know, and I'm not sure if anger ... being angry now, is a part of the process and I've got to do that, but I'd like to ... I guess my uh ... I guess my mind uh academically or something, you know, and something other than emotion or whatever, like, would like to tell me that, uh, I'd like to uh ... to not be angry and to skip over that part, if that's a part of the process, you know? But I'm not sure I can do that , you know.",1975
Kathy,3,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Your mind says sort of, ""Oh, cool it. Don't ... don't get into uh, such strong emo- tion"".",1975
Kathy,4,client,Kathy,"For sure. It almost seems like that ... that uh whatever is happening in my environment or whatever happened in my environment is pulling me into again uh, that kind of a trap ... that kind of a system that I don't particularly care ... er, er, you know, if you know what I mean.",1975
Kathy,4,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. I think I get that: that your ... your mind is taking the place of the system in saying now, uh, ""Play it right. Do the right ... do the proper thing"".",1975
Kathy,5,client,Kathy,Right.,1975
Kathy,5,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But some other part of you is saying, ""Yeah, but there's some anger there"".",1975
Kathy,6,client,Kathy,For sure. For sure.,1975
Kathy,6,therapist,Carl Rogers,There's some real anger there.,1975
Kathy,7,client,Kathy,"Right. It's ... it's almost like in this country ... and, and I've always felt like this ... you only have about two options, you know, when you deal with race ... you either have to be ... you're either a racist or you're an anti-racist. And that doesn't really seem to be the kind of thing that I'm, you know .... I don't really care to be an anti-racist, if you know what I mean anymore. Uh, and I don't wanna be a reflection of any other ... of any other larger society at all. I really don't want to ...",1975
Kathy,7,therapist,Carl Rogers,You'd like to get in touch with what's going on in you.,1975
Kathy,8,client,Kathy,For sure.,1975
Kathy,8,therapist,Carl Rogers,Not ... not some label or other.,1975
Kathy,9,client,Kathy,"For sure. I think that I could probably trust that a lot better than, than, than trusting what's happening or what has happened. And, um, and when I think about that ... when I think about all of that, you know, uh, the things that we talked about ... I, I, I think that, um, that's worse than the leukemia.",1975
Kathy,9,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uh, uh-huh.",1975
Kathy,10,client,Kathy,"You know? I know that may sound very strange or whatever, but a lot of things have been strange",1975
Kathy,10,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Mmm.,1975
Kathy,11,client,Kathy,"You know, since this time; and, and what has happened to me didn't just start when I found out that I, you know, was going to die. Kind of thing.",1975
Kathy,11,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Let me see if I understand that. That you feel as though, um, what the culture and people and so on have ... have done to you ... that's really caused you more suffering than the leukemia. Is that what you're saying?",1975
Kathy,12,client,Kathy,"I think so. I think so. And to some extent that ... that would ... that is mild ... like, for instance, you know, you ... I don't know what would have happened if I had died or if I will or whatever, but I certainly know what's happening now and what happened.",1975
Kathy,12,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,13,client,Kathy,You see.,1975
Kathy,13,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,14,client,Kathy,"And to some extent that ... that kind of leukemia, that kind of deterioration of the body is the same kind of thing that happened to my mind. And um ... You know, it’s ...",1975
Kathy,14,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So really, what the culture did to you was give you a cancer of the mind.",1975
Kathy,15,client,Kathy,"Yeah. I, I, I, I really ... I think, I really want to say that and I really want to, um, and I believe it, you know, and I guess that part of me that's, that's my culture or is a part of the total, ... is saying that it's not all that good to be angry, you know, because militancy is frowned upon or whatever, you know. And I guess I'm using mili- militant in my sense because of ... it's, it's just traditionally, you know, when blacks become angry they're, they're not angry ... they're militant. You know what I mean ?",1975
Kathy,15,therapist,Carl Rogers,I know. Another label.,1975
Kathy,16,client,Kathy,"Mmm. For sure, for sure, for sure. Yeah. And I ... and there's nobody that I can put my finger on, you know ... that person that started the whole thing ... that process, you know, because that would probably be a lot better for me, you know, then I probably would, would try to, to do ... to do that person in.",1975
Kathy,16,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah ... If you could ... If you could pin it on one person, then your rage would be justified and you could really get after that person.",1975
Kathy,17,client,Kathy,"Mmm. But how, you know ... but how do you blame somebody else who's sick? You know? And I think that people that do that to other people, or at least - when it was done to me, um ... they're really sick, you know. And here I am, you know, trying to ... you know, I don't know if it was forgiving, I don't know if I'm sounding confused or whatever, maybe, you know, but trying to accept their sickness, you know.",1975
Kathy,17,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,18,client,Kathy,"And at the same time, you know, I really haven't had the opportunity of letting anybody accept mine.",1975
Kathy,18,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,19,client,Kathy,"Or maybe I haven't given it to them, but ...",1975
Kathy,19,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, maybe you haven't given it to them.",1975
Kathy,20,client,Kathy,Right.,1975
Kathy,20,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That's what I sense is going on now ... that you feel ""there's so many reasons why I really shouldn't express my anger. I'll, I'll talk about all those reasons"".",1975
Kathy,21,client,Kathy,"Yeah , for sure. I don't know really, you know. Maybe I'll just be angry one day and maybe I'll really feel better or whatever, you know, and, and I ... when I, when I smile, I ... I'm uh, you know, I'm smiling but there’s a lot of ... and I'm sure you know that ... there's a lot of anger there. You know, but it's not my nature to be angry It's not my nature to be angry, but I feel angry.",1975
Kathy,21,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. Um, and uh so I hear you explaining and explaining that uh, uh, ""that's not my nature to be angry. It's just that I am angry right now"".",1975
Kathy,22,client,Kathy,"For sure , for sure. And to try to be angry in a productive ... I don't know how you'd be angry in a productive way ... you know, in terms of ... It's like now when I ... when I respond to people, you know ... if, if when you encounter people, you know, whether it's in the street, whether it's in a professional situation or whatever, you know ...if people send out certain messages and wh ... no matter what they're saying or whatever ... there are certain kinds of messages that I'm getting, you know. They're saying that, ""hey, you know ... that isn't for me"" kind of thing, you know. And that's before, you know, I'd like to work with that, and ride it ... like to try to communicate without alienating ... people or whatever, but now, you know, I'm ending up saying, you know, like ...""hey, that's a bunch of crap"", you know. ""Don't ... don't, don't tell me about the way that I should do it or, or give me all that nonverbal stuff about, um, you saying that I'm OK, but by nonver- bally saying ... ""hey"", you know, ""you're really not OK"", you know. And I don't want to hear that kind of stuff anymore.",1975
Kathy,22,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I get what you're saying and I also feel quite strongly that I want to say, ""it's OK with me if you're angry here""...",1975
Kathy,23,client,Kathy,"... But I don't, you know ... it's hard to know how to be angry, you know ... hard to ...",1975
Kathy,23,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sure, sure, I'm not saying you have to be. . I'm just saying it's OK with me.",1975
Kathy,24,client,Kathy,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,24,therapist,Carl Rogers,"If you feel like being angry, you can be angry.",1975
Kathy,25,client,Kathy,You really believe that?,1975
Kathy,25,therapist,Carl Rogers,Damn right.,1975
Kathy,26,client,Kathy,"Well. I'm not sure how to respond to that at all, you know, because a part of that anger is, you know, the ... the hurt, and maybe if I’m... maybe what's happening is that if I'm ... if I become angry and I really let it hang out, that I really will see how hurt I am.",1975
Kathy,26,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,27,client,Kathy,"And um, you know, that just came to me as you were talking.",1975
Kathy,27,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,28,client,Kathy,"That, you know ...",1975
Kathy,28,therapist,Carl Rogers,Perhaps at a deeper level you're afraid of the hurt that you may experience if you let yourself experience the anger.,1975
Kathy,29,client,Kathy,For sure.,1975
Kathy,29,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,30,client,Kathy,Really.,1975
Kathy,30,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,31,client,Kathy,"Um, whew ... I keep getting these blocks, you know ... these, you know ... when I come to something like that, you know, because, you know, to me that's a revelation and I'm not really sure that, uh, risking being angry I guess ... or something like that, you know.",1975
Kathy,31,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,32,client,Kathy,"Losing control, maybe.",1975
Kathy,32,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, mmm.",1975
Kathy,33,client,Kathy,You know? Well ... .,1975
Kathy,33,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I really do get that ... that this ... this realization that, ""Maybe what I'm most afraid of is the hurt that I might experience"", um, makes you more cautious about whether you should, whether you should or could really let go of the ... of the anger.",1975
Kathy,34,client,Kathy,"I really don't know, I think that ...",1975
Kathy,34,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's a risk.,1975
Kathy,35,client,Kathy,"Right. And it's, you know ... I hadn't really thought about that before.",1975
Kathy,35,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. It's new.,1975
Kathy,36,client,Kathy,"Yeah. It's, uh ... I guess I would be ... and I'd re-really would admit openly that I'm hurt. I, I said that I've been hurt.",1975
Kathy,36,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,37,client,Kathy,"And I think, you know, that I, I feel I've been hurt, but to really ... to show that, you know ...",1975
Kathy,37,therapist,Carl Rogers,"To show it and ... I guess to let yourself sort of ... experience it, that ... that, I guess would be difficult.",1975
Kathy,38,client,Kathy,"Yeah, I, I don't know. It ... it's, it, it's as scary, I think, as the possibility of ... that I had before ... more than before, about dying, you know.",1975
Kathy,38,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Mmm.,1975
Kathy,39,client,Kathy,"And maybe, you know ... guess I was really scared because of the symptoms, you know, of, of, you know ... not being able to walk and not being able to see, and things like that, you know. And having to depend on somebody, you know. And for God's sake, you know ... having to show somebody that I'm ... that I'm hurt. And how, you know, how can I trust that to somebody, you know. Umm ...",1975
Kathy,39,therapist,Carl Rogers,Seems like a horribly big risk.,1975
Kathy,40,client,Kathy,"Yeah, it is . Seems to be getting bigger and bigger as we talk!",1975
Kathy,40,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. ""Suppose I really expose to somebody the fact that I'm deeply, deeply hurt"". That in a sense would be comparable to having to be dependent on someone when you can't walk or something like that.",1975
Kathy,41,client,Kathy,"Right. Yeah. I'd like to just to say it's my ... it’s trying my conditioning. I try not to ... one way out of it ... and, uh ... But that ... that isn't really acceptable to me now because I ... I, I, I, I feel that I ... I feel like ... that I have to express that, that hurt or whatever, but you know, I can say that, you know, and I know right down here, you know, I'm ... I'm saying that and when I say it, you know, it kind of keeps something down here. , you know.",1975
Kathy,41,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. You're saying it from here up. .,1975
Kathy,42,client,Kathy,"For sure. For sure . I don't know how to do that exactly ... whatever ... It's like I don't drink a lot, you know, because I don't really want to, uh ... ... experience that kind of, uh, you know ... alcohol to me is a depressant anyway, and um, you know ... that's about the only thing I really like to get out ... to really get out, you know, and maybe saying, you know, like I'll love somebody. ""I gave of myself"". I did the ... hell ... the best I could, and it wasn't good enough, you know, and you know, demand on top of demand and everything like that, you know ... It's just, you know ... Shit ... you know, it's, it's like that I'd like to be able uhh ... and I said this here, the other day or when I was talking to you ... that I'd like to be able to, to say that ... yeah, ""I was screwed over and I got hurt and everything else"", like that, or whatever, but it's an ... it's almost an admission in a, in a way on another level of, of ... of saying that they got the best of me, you know.",1975
Kathy,42,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,43,client,Kathy,And I really don' want ...,1975
Kathy,43,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,44,client,Kathy,"You know, I really don't want anybody historically to get, have ... to have gotten the best of me ... but they did. They did. They beat the hell out of me.",1975
Kathy,44,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You don't want to say, ""I really was defeated at times"", and yet that's the truth.",1975
Kathy,45,client,Kathy,"Mmm. It is. You know, being ... having it being all right to be defeated and be beaten and I don't know if there's any value in, you know ... maybe to myself ... admitting it to myself, or whatever, you know, but you know, I ... I'm really finding out I got a lot of , hangups in terms of, in that line that I hadn't thought of before, you know ... in terms of, you know, because I don't want to be beaten. But I was, you know.",1975
Kathy,45,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,46,client,Kathy,"Because I think when you are hurt, that's being beaten except, you know ...",1975
Kathy,46,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,47,client,Kathy,"And I allowed myself to, and I don't regret caring, and I don't regret loving or whatever, but you know ... like I'm a ... I'm a kid, you know, I'm a kid in a way. I like to be loved too; I like to be uh ... ... some reciprocity. And I'm going to start, I think, expecting that. You know ... without being cold or anything like that. But I have to, you know, start getting something back in return.",1975
Kathy,47,therapist,Carl Rogers,You want love to be mutual.,1975
Kathy,48,client,Kathy,"For sure, for sure. And I don't want to have, uh get in the situation like I'm in now, you know, where I'm afraid to, to, to, show anybody that I am, I'm hurt, you know. Scared to death ... terrified.",1975
Kathy,48,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Something really awful about showing ... letting anyone know that ""I'm hurt"". ""I'm hurting"".",1975
Kathy,49,client,Kathy,"Sure, sure. It's, you know ... it has something to do with being a man and it has something to do with ... with the race thing, you know.",1975
Kathy,49,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,50,client,Kathy,It has something to do with the relationship ...,1975
Kathy,50,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,51,client,Kathy,"Maybe the failure of a relationship, uh. A ... a lot of things, you know ... a father not being in the home with his children.",1975
Kathy,51,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,52,client,Kathy,"You know, I really feel like being a victim.",1975
Kathy,52,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,53,client,Kathy,"I don't know how to get that up at all. Every time I get close to that, I take a drink of water! Uh, I don't know if that acts to keep it down there or what.",1975
Kathy,53,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Maybe ... maybe, maybe that'll keep it from coming up above this level .",1975
Kathy,54,client,Kathy,"For sure. I, I don't know. See, how it, it really isn't what I want either. You know, I want it to get out and stay out, you know.",1975
Kathy,54,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I would like to let it out"".",1975
Kathy,55,client,Kathy,"Yeah. So maybe if you have any exorcism type powers or whatever, that, uh ... maybe you can just do that and then I'll be free of that, you know. Because that's what it feels like ... it feels like there's something there, you know, that I really ... and I've identified it. I think I've identified it, you know, because I know there're some times when there’s such a big lump in my throat, you know, and that I explain, I give myself a lot of reasons why I shouldn't be feeling like that, you know.",1975
Kathy,55,therapist,Carl Rogers,"A big lump of hurt, though. And how to let that hurt come out in the open ... how to let it ... emerge and be out here instead of way down locked in here.",1975
Kathy,56,client,Kathy,"Right. Yeah. You know, I, I, I never believe in cookbook answers to anything, even when I cook I don't use a cookbook. I just don't believe in it. I think, but I'd really like to be able for somebody to tell me to, you know, maybe how to do that in about five minutes and be through with it so I can live the rest of my life in peace. You know what I mean?",1975
Kathy,56,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sure. It'd be awfully nice if somebody could say, ""Now, if you do this and this, all your hurt will come out and it will be gone forever"".",1975
Kathy,57,client,Kathy,For sure.,1975
Kathy,57,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Be great, wouldn't it?",1975
Kathy,58,client,Kathy,For sure. I have a suspicion that maybe you know some things that I don't know.,1975
Kathy,58,therapist,Carl Rogers,No.,1975
Kathy,59,client,Kathy,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,59,therapist,Carl Rogers,"No, I'm not holding out on you.",1975
Kathy,60,client,Kathy,"Hey, I, I believe that. I, I ... it feels like I'm holding out on myself ... You know. But hell, you know. I don't know.",1975
Kathy,60,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I think it goes back to some of the things you mentioned. A man doesn't admit he's hurt ... a black man especially doesn't admit that he's been hurt by anything. Uh, a father doesn't admit he's been hurt by being away from his children. Just too many things that say: no, no, no ... don't let it out. But inside there's the hurt.",1975
Kathy,61,client,Kathy,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,61,therapist,Carl Rogers,"A phrase came to me a minute ago that, “If you could let that out, ...” I don't know whether this will ring true to you or not ... “If you could let that out, it would be the Voice of a Victim.” I don't know if that makes any sense or not.",1975
Kathy,62,client,Kathy,"Mmm, yeah. And I don't know what, you know, I don't know if I have any control over that, you know, of what, of what ... of what would happen, you know. It's like a friend of mine the other day, who helped me through my illness and everything, he says, you know, when I've encountered another person that, you know, a very intelligent sort that was talking a bunch of intellectual garbage about feelings and things like that ... that I really wa ... wanted to just, to, you know, I really saw the ... him ... the society, the culture, right in him, you know. And I really wanted to just ... to kind of deck him, you know, and that's something that's not uh my nature whatever, but I could just really wonder that ...",1975
Kathy,62,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, just like to have socked him.",1975
Kathy,63,client,Kathy,"Yeah, yeah. And my friend said, you know, ""one of these days"", he says, if you ... ""if you don't get it together"" or, or something, he says ... not ""that if you don't get it together"", but he says, ""one of these days you're gonna really lose it, you know"". You know what I mean? It ... it's that I want to get rid of all that stuff that was done to me and not have to hear all that other stuff, or to be able to deal with it in a very constructive kind of a way, you know. But still it grinds me because of all the other stuff that's happened to me. And when I see other people doing it to other people, or whatever, it grinds me ... it makes me angry, you know? And I would think that in those situations, I've begun to kind of strike out, you know, or like you know, protecting somebody else or fighting for somebody else or whatever, and like I'm not sure what I did for myself, though, over those years that all that happened to me or whatever. Annnd, if I could cry and have it be all right...",1975
Kathy,63,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That's what I was thinking. I was just thinking, if you could only cry.",1975
Kathy,64,client,Kathy,"Yeah. It would, you know, but that's, that's a trip, you know ... that's a trip like uh...",1975
Kathy,64,therapist,Carl Rogers,"First place, a man doesn't cry.",1975
Kathy,65,client,Kathy,"Yeah. For sure, for sure. That's a fact.",1975
Kathy,65,therapist,Carl Rogers,But I guess you're saying that times you have that lump in your throat and you sure as hell feel like crying.,1975
Kathy,66,client,Kathy,"For sure, for sure. Uhh, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe going to a movie or one of those old, you know, movies, dramas, or something like that ...",1975
Kathy,66,therapist,Carl Rogers,Tear jerkers?,1975
Kathy,67,client,Kathy,"Right ... so I can cry, you know, and have an excuse to cry, you know, but crying for myself, I'm not sure that, uh ... I'm just not sure that's going to be constructive, you know .",1975
Kathy,67,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, you say you're not sure whether crying for yourself is constructive. I feel also you're afraid of crying for yourself.",1975
Kathy,68,client,Kathy,"I may be, I may be, because if I feel like crying and I don't, whenever there's some things that are, you know ... but you see, that's a part of it too, you know? It's ... you know, and I, and I can't ... I, I hate to keep using these things of, you know, we're just being so conditioned not to, you know, from a little thing of, you know, like oh, you know, ""be little, little men or big boys"", or whatever. ""Don't cry"", and, and ...",1975
Kathy,68,therapist,Carl Rogers,Probably your seven-year-old could cry.,1975
Kathy,69,client,Kathy,"Yeah, for sure. I cried, I remember crying, but I cried alone. I never let anybody see me cry, you know? I wonder how many people have seen me cry! Two or three in the whole world. It's kind of interesting, you know. I remember living with my ex-wife, or whatever, she cried all the time. She cried get- ting up in the morning, and you know, just crying for crying, you know. I asked her sometimes about why she cried, and she just said, ""I don't know, just wanted to, felt good"". I don't know if that was healthy or whatever, but it probably is a lot more healthier than what I did.",1975
Kathy,69,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. It probably is better than never letting anyone see you cry.,1975
Kathy,70,client,Kathy,"Right. There's just so many other ways to do it, you know, that I've learned, you know, like working hard. Not thinking about it, you know. Not thinking about it.",1975
Kathy,70,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Just seeing that all the sorrow that you feel for yourself and for what's happened to you and all that, uh, ""that doesn't really exist"". It's just uh, you're too busy to have any thoughts of that.",1975
Kathy,71,client,Kathy,For sure.,1975
Kathy,71,therapist,Carl Rogers,But the sorrow is still there.,1975
Kathy,72,client,Kathy,"For sure. Yeah. And I really don't know how to de ... and I really don't know how to deal with that. I really don't. I really don't. You know, just really giving so much of yourself and it's really crazy. Too much. .",1975
Kathy,72,therapist,Carl Rogers,"If you did cry, what would some of the themes of that crying be?",1975
Kathy,73,client,Kathy,"Well, just you know, all those, you know, hours that I, you know, that I spent away from my family and that I gave up my family and didn't see my children grow, you know. I really wanted that to be for some kind of a higher level, some kind of a cause, you know. But not to have that uh, to see anything, any benefit that I did. You know, all of that work, I mean, hours and hours and ... but it's just incredible, and I think that would be one, you know, I was saying, ""Damn it, why in the hell did I spend so much time?"" ""Why did I spend so much time?"". You know, the leukemia, the ... everything that happened to me or whatever would be properly deserved if one person's life would have been changed, or something, you know. And like, and maybe, maybe it has or whatever, but, but I think that I, I don't trust that ... that it was worth it, you see?",1975
Kathy,73,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. Yeah. You invested a whole lot of caring, a whole lot of your self, and you feel real sorrow that maybe nothing came of that.",1975
Kathy,74,client,Kathy,"Yeah, and I'd also like to uh just kind of cry for my father-in-law too, who was killed before I ... about six months before I got the leukemia. I'd like to really tell him that I uh, that I really loved him a great deal.",1975
Kathy,74,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm ... So you're telling me in place of telling him and maybe you could even speak to him, I don't know. But at any rate, you really would like to tell him, ""I loved you, you know that? I loved you"".",1975
Kathy,75,client,Kathy,"Well, I, I really would, you know. Th-thisss situation that we started out ... I was married, and we married somebody of a different race, and we fought it out tooth and nail or whatever, and but, but yet we loved each other and we fished together and he was great with me. You know, he had a very ... to other people, a very cold way, you know, of, you know, ""By God, this is the way it's going to be"" and so forth. But I saw him when he was hurt too, and um when he was killed in, in 1975, in a, in a hunting accident, it just really took all of it, you know. Because you see, he helped me to, to try to get out of that stuff. He's saying, ""Hey, what are you doing, you know? Do ... what do you really want to do?"". And at the time I wanted to, you know, to open my own restaurant or whatever. And so he was going to help me finance that restaurant, you know. And so a week later he was killed. One week. And um, and so we were getting so close, but that I really never told him that, ""Hey Dad, you know, hey Dad, I love you, I really love you"". And we told each other, I guess, in some ways or whatever, but it's not the same as saying it, you know, as saying, ""Dad, I really love you. I really care"".",1975
Kathy,75,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You feel really sad that you never gave him a straight message on that, that ""I love you"".",1975
Kathy,76,client,Kathy,"For sure, for sure, because he was straighter th ... with me than a lot of people, you know.",1975
Kathy,76,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,77,client,Kathy,"And to now to be taken away from all of that, you see, because it's only been, I don't know, eight months or so since I ceased all communication with my family, you know, family that ... my wife's family that I've loved and I've cared for and that I buried my father-in-law and that was it. That was the ... and then even the family began to take on those same things of the culture, you know.",1975
Kathy,77,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Things began to fall apart for you there, mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,78,client,Kathy,"For sure, for sure, you know. And lately, I don't know, falling apart or at least my being able to see that uh that it really wasn't, it wasn't true. It wasn't real, I wasn't getting, I wasn't getting anything back, I wasn't getting any nourishment back, you know. Smiles and polite kisses and things like that, you know. That is, you know, part of the hurt, you know. I'd rather for somebody to say, you know, ""I think you're a lousy S.O.B. or whatever"", as opposed to saying, ""Hello, dear, how are you?"" You know, you know?.",1975
Kathy,78,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. When the real message perhaps is, ""I think you're a lousy S.O.B."".",1975
Kathy,79,client,Kathy,"Right, right, you know.",1975
Kathy,79,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,80,client,Kathy,". Yeah, so there's, you know, there's a few things.",1975
Kathy,80,therapist,Carl Rogers,Part of the sorrow would be for your father-in-law. You'd really weep for him.,1975
Kathy,81,client,Kathy,"I ... yeah, I think I would, you know. And just maybe I still think that I really wish that I could, you know, just say, ""Hey, you know, you guys, you really don't realize what you did to me"", you know? Because for a while, I just, you know, saying, well, you know, ""racist"", ""terrible"", ""blah, blah, blah"". But that doesn't say anything, you know, because it doesn't say how I really feel, you know. But they, but it, but it ... they wouldn't understand that, they wouldn't understand how a black person could be hurt, you know, because if you don't accept a person as human, how can you, how can you think about, you know, like ... it's like thinking a dog could be hurt of whatever, you know, people that don't have dogs and don't understand them, you know?",1975
Kathy,81,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But you get some satisfaction out of saying, ""You people don't realize how much you hurt me"". They might not be able to hear that message, but you'd get some satisfaction out of ... out of expressing that, out of ... out of letting, letting yourself know, letting others know that, ""God, I've been hurt!""",1975
Kathy,82,client,Kathy,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,82,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I've been wounded"".",1975
Kathy,83,client,Kathy,"I just don't think I could do that 'cause I just don't think that that that, I just don't trust, you know, you know, I wouldn't do it because I just wouldn't want to give them the satisfaction, you know. It's like I feel like, you know, my saying, you know, ""Maybe that is my feeling"". But I, I have too many times, you know, when you know, I opened up a little bit or whatever, and someone says ... ... you know, squash!",1975
Kathy,83,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So there are probably loads of people you wouldn't dare open up to on that, but I guess you're opening up to me to say, ""Yes, but I have been really wounded, badly, by a lot of people"".",1975
Kathy,84,client,Kathy,"For sure. Mmm. I maybe think that you can understand that a little bit in terms of about hurt and that, you know, that ... you know, that I, you know, that I'm a person and uh, you know, I'm a person. And I don't really want that denied to me ... you know, ever again.",1975
Kathy,84,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,85,client,Kathy,You know. I could really get angry.,1975
Kathy,85,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. mmm.,1975
Kathy,86,client,Kathy,"I don't you know, I just ... that's not going to happen to me, you know. In a way, you know, I don't want to love anybody like I did my father-in-law again, and for God's sake, you know, that's, that's painful, but I know that's terribly sick too, that you have to love, you have to continue to love people. Or whatever. But at that time, it was the only thing that was productive. It was the only thing that was something that was, you know, as Fromm talks about, biophilic. It was growth; it was nourishing. And that was the only thing, and that was just taken away from me, and it was taken away from me just ...",1975
Kathy,86,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just like that.,1975
Kathy,87,client,Kathy,"You know, It was just really strange, you know.",1975
Kathy,87,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that, that's been a ... a hurt and a shock and makes you feel, ""I can't risk myself loving somebody else like that because that might disappear some way or other"".",1975
Kathy,88,client,Kathy,"For sure, for sure. For sure. I certainly don't want any more in-laws. . Be they uh whatever color. I'm not sure I want them, but now you know ... And that's ... I think that's part of it, you know. More so than, than the risking loving somebody, just because their death ... death I know is inevitable. But it's that, that other collection of things around it, or whatever. But you know, it's... it’s crazy.",1975
Kathy,88,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's what?,1975
Kathy,89,client,Kathy,"It's crazy to love, you know, it's just like loving a pet rock or something, you know, it's nothing. Nothing, you don't feel.",1975
Kathy,89,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. mmm. ""Love goes out from me but nothing comes back"".",1975
Kathy,90,client,Kathy,"Right. And I'm not so sure that that, that I want that, it to work like that again, you know. And maybe by ... maybe saying that, I don't know, maybe you know, calling, say, ""Hey, I really was hurt"" and everything like that or whatever. Maybe that would be a start or whatever, but I just don't really trust that they really understand that. I don't really, really uh ... it took my wife who lived with me for seven years, you know, after I left, maybe six, seven months to understand that I was, that I was hurt, that I was ... that I was desperate.",1975
Kathy,90,therapist,Carl Rogers,You feel there's so little chance of anyone else really understanding you.,1975
Kathy,91,client,Kathy,"Mmm, that sounds kind of, yeah, well, , so little chance for that group of people understanding me. And I believe it. I really believe it, you know. It would just, it would be like me trying to, uh, to understand or to, to tell Dick Nixon or something about my feelings, that I just don't think he could relate to that,you know. And I'm using, and ... and I'm really serious about that example, because he's so far away from me and my reality, and that family, you know, I found out was so far away from me and my reality that, you know, it was insane, you know. It was really insane, you know. So I think on one level I feel OK for loving them.",1975
Kathy,91,therapist,Carl Rogers,You feel...?,1975
Kathy,92,client,Kathy,OK for loving them.,1975
Kathy,92,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I see, mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,93,client,Kathy,"But I don't feel OK for sharing any more with them. And sharing that hurt is just, you know ... and maybe sharing it with other people would be OK. But I know I'm moving away from the other too, you know, that's really important to me right now. And I don't know ... maybe I won't ... I'm not rushing it, it just seems to want to get out and jump out or whatever, but, you know, you know. It's clearly must have really gone through ... my body really must have gone through some changes or whatever because, you know, something there is just keeping it, keeping it down, and I know all those reasons but I can't uh, I can't seem to muster that power to ... ... to get it, to get that out, you know, to really, you know.",1975
Kathy,93,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's still too much locked in.,1975
Kathy,94,client,Kathy,"Yeah, for sure. But it really, it really helps, you know, um, 'cause it's, it's, it's just, you know ... it's incredible, you know, this is the first time I've talked to anybody that, you know, that I haven't really been in control. To some extent I've really given up a lot of control uh ... to you.",1975
Kathy,94,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, sort of letting things loose rather than ... ... keeping them under your control.",1975
Kathy,95,client,Kathy,For sure.,1975
Kathy,95,therapist,Carl Rogers,And that's a new experience.,1975
Kathy,96,client,Kathy,"A very new experience for me. Very new experience. And maybe I don't know if it's just not, just it's a function, function of that too, you know, or something, you know. Things are rattling around in my head now , you know. But all the other, it's just bullshit, and like I have been hurt and I really don't want to get involved anymore in terms of with people that can't return love and can't accept people. I just don't really want to get involved anymore. I'm sick and tired ... sick of it.",1975
Kathy,96,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sounds as though you're more accepting of yourself as a person who is vulnerable, who has been hurt, who is hurting, and who wants love ... who doesn't want it all to be a one-way street of giving love. You want love back in return.",1975
Kathy,97,client,Kathy,"Mmm, mmm. Yeah. And I wanna be able to uh, to feel and to, and to cry. And not to be afraid of crying, and, and not to be afraid of, uh ... I want to be able and I'm going to work for that. I really wanna work for that. I, I know I do, you know, I just have this thing, ah, you know. If I trust the doctors, I'd have them cut 'em, cut me open and get that out, you know, but I don't.",1975
Kathy,97,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Probably'd be simpler to have an operation.,1975
Kathy,98,client,Kathy,"Oh yeah! . Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I, but do you, do you, do you, do you, do you feel that ... you know, like I really wanna, you know, tell you how hurt I am, but I'm not, I can't tell you?",1975
Kathy,98,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I understand that. I ... you're, you're uh, it visualizes in my mind you're walking all around the edge of that pit, but you're not really letting yourself down into it; so you're letting me know all about it , but, but not it.",1975
Kathy,99,client,Kathy,Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Don't know how to do that. You know?,1975
Kathy,99,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. I, I hear you saying, ""I really want to get to that, but it will have to be at my pace. I can't ... I can't force it. I can't... but I do want to get to it"".",1975
Kathy,100,client,Kathy,"Yeah. 'Cause I want to get to it really fast, you know, because that's all a part of me right now that's really ... I really feel that's sick, that's really the cancer, you know. That if I could eliminate that, I could eliminate all the cancer from my body. I really believe it, you know. And I really blame, I really blame the way I lived and the stress and everything else like that on, on on the disease. I really do.",1975
Kathy,100,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You mean, you blame the disease on all that stress, is what you mean?",1975
Kathy,101,client,Kathy,"Right, for sure, yeah. I have it turned around. For sure. I do. I do. And to some extent, I blame racism. You know, I just don't want to get caught up into that anymore, you know, and I want to continue to give, but I don't, I, I, I'm just not going to do it the way I did it before. And uh, I don't know. May ... yelling sometimes you know, like when I came in here, I was thinking about yelling, you know, one of those long, big long ... you know. But I'm not sure that I want to do that.",1975
Kathy,101,therapist,Carl Rogers,You could try it.,1975
Kathy,102,client,Kathy,"You know, I don't know, you know That wouldn't be cultured.",1975
Kathy,102,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Standards, standards, standards.",1975
Kathy,103,client,Kathy,"Sure, I mean, I'm really, I was really socialized.",1975
Kathy,103,therapist,Carl Rogers,You were brought up right ... weren't you?,1975
Kathy,104,client,Kathy,"Oh yeah, I was. I learned all of it ... all of it.",1975
Kathy,104,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And still in spite of yourself, buy a good deal of it.",1975
Kathy,105,client,Kathy,Yeah. Yeah.,1975
Kathy,105,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You really don't want to, but still you find ... ... you can't do the uncultu- red thing.",1975
Kathy,106,client,Kathy,"For sure. There were standards, I guess, and uh, that are really foreign to me, but uh, you know, the, the thing that, you know ... that I thought about you know, and like you know, I was like in terms of expressing my anger, whatever, comes out in terms of, you know , possible obscenity, you know , you know, like calling somebody a bunch of something or whatever would really, you know, I don't know what it would do, but you know, I'd really like to do that, you know.",1975
Kathy,106,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That helps to explain why I feel you've kept your language more, quite guarded here. I, I, I realize I've used more profanity than you have.",1975
Kathy,107,client,Kathy,"For sure, you know. It's not because of, you know, but I don't know, it's just a, a part of that, you know, like I was just ...",1975
Kathy,107,therapist,Carl Rogers,You'd like to just tell off the bastard!,1975
Kathy,108,client,Kathy,"Yeah, right, right, right. For sure. Oh my goodness!",1975
Kathy,108,therapist,Carl Rogers,You can't even do that.,1975
Kathy,109,client,Kathy,"Oh, it's incredible. I don't know. Whew! I'm getting warm.",1975
Kathy,109,therapist,Carl Rogers,Both inside and outside,1975
Kathy,110,client,Kathy,"Yes, right, right. I'm getting extremely warm. Um, yeah, maybe I'll be able to do it one day, I guess. Maybe I'll be able to do it . I really haven't used ... but see, when I get out of here, I'll use a lot of profanity, you know. I don't, you know, just in terms of, you know, like I ... I, I, I, I think I did, you know, when I was really angry talking to my wife and things like that, you know, where I was just, ""Goddammit"", and all of that, you know, ""bastards"" and some other things and like, you know, I was raised properly, you know . Uh, yeah, but I think part of that would be a part of expressing my feelings and everything like that, you know.",1975
Kathy,110,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It wouldn't come out in nice, polite language.",1975
Kathy,111,client,Kathy,"No, it wouldn't. It, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't. To my teachers that I had, to the family that I had, uh, to a lot of my colleagues, you know, and others. And ... but I don't know if I really want to tell them, you know, maybe it's just a part of just being proud and, and everything else like that, but at least to myself I, I need to get it out and openly.",1975
Kathy,111,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. You may not tell it to them face to face, but you need to get it out of yourself somehow.",1975
Kathy,112,client,Kathy,"Mmm. Somehow, yeah, yeah. Really rotten and I really feel s ... you know, really screwed. I really feel ... ... so badly.",1975
Kathy,112,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""The bastards really screwed me"".",1975
Kathy,113,client,Kathy,"Yeah, I know. They ... they got me, you know. It was just like uh, being part, I guess, that had something to do with being in, you know, I guess, you know, I just ... I just wipe 'em out, you know, if you don't get them with their bodies you do it in their mind, you know, like it happened, you know, and it was ... it was real, you know, and you know, to try to describe that hell to somebody is just the, the hardest thing, you know. But it's like, you know, just somebody knocking you down ... ... and it's somebody coming and stomping on you and spitting on you and everything like that, and like it's just, you know, and just being at ... feeling like garbage.",1975
Kathy,113,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,114,client,Kathy,"And I have the feeling that people have made me feel like garbage, you know, and like ... you know? I'm sure that my friends would say, you know, God, I had everything. But I didn't have everything. I didn't have everything. Certainly didn't have that respect as a person.",1975
Kathy,114,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But there were a lot of people who, though they may or may not have beaten you physically, treated you in a way that just trampled on you and beat you up and spit on you and made you a nobody, a piece of garbage.",1975
Kathy,115,client,Kathy,Right. And it won't happen again. Not if I can help it .,1975
Kathy,115,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,116,client,Kathy,"It's 'cause I'm really tired of fighting. Really tired of expending that kind of energy. It really is just, is straining, it's too draining, and like, you know, I don't really know what's gonna happen in terms of, you know, how I'm going to do that, you know. Get it out or or whatever, but you know, I just don't really want to say that I'm hurt or whatever, because that is ... that isn't even descriptive enough for what really happened.",1975
Kathy,116,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah. To say a word like that or several of the words you've used just isn't at all the same as feeling those feelings inside and really feeling them fully.,1975
Kathy,117,client,Kathy,"It really is, uh, I don't know if you saw ""The Excorcist"", but it really is, really is, you know, that oohf, you know, I remember a scene in that movie where the girl who threw up this green slime, you know, and that's really, it's that, you know, it's that bad, you know, it's, you know, it's that, it's that bad. 'Cause I know it ... I know it now, you know. It's not a part of me and my body really wants to reject that, but how to, how to throw that up is ...",1975
Kathy,117,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, how to ... how to vomit up that green slime that's been a part of your experience.",1975
Kathy,118,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Maybe I'm just afraid I'll look horrible, you know, or, or that I'd look horrible, or whatever, expressing that kind of anger, that kind of uh, that kind of hurt or whatever.",1975
Kathy,118,therapist,Carl Rogers,You wouldn't look civilized; you wouldn't look cultured.,1975
Kathy,119,client,Kathy,"I don't, I don't know, you know. I don't really know. But right now, the ... more than getting that out, I think the, uh, the overriding thing is that I wanna keep at least that control, to control that, for fear of, you see, I don't really want to get sick again You know, and like I think this, the slightest, you know, just by being weak, by submitting to that kind of pain, um, somehow bring back my uh ...",1975
Kathy,119,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You wonder about that ... whether if you, if you let out all the ... all the hell that you've experienced inside, it might uh, it might bring back your illness.",1975
Kathy,120,client,Kathy,"And that doesn't sound logical, does it? I know that.",1975
Kathy,120,therapist,Carl Rogers,O.K.,1975
Kathy,121,client,Kathy,"Thank you, thank you very much. Oh, God. What a ... mmm. . I don't know. God, you know, I feel so beaten. I ... when I feel beaten right now, and I'm not sure why, but that in a way the, that I got, uh ... I really got something to say and it just, you know, and I know I'd feel better. But maybe I w- ouldn't, you know, I really talk ... God, I realize how I'm talking in circles. I seem to be talking in circles. Does it sound like uh?",1975
Kathy,121,therapist,Carl Rogers,"No, not quite. It's more spirals, I think. Getting, as you say, getting very close, you feel, you feel beaten right now as though, if only something could come out, you wouldn't feel beaten.",1975
Kathy,122,client,Kathy,"Yeah Think that you know, just ... that turned, that almost turned me into something really inhuman.",1975
Kathy,122,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1975
Kathy,123,client,Kathy,I really almost let it turn me into something really inhuman.,1975
Kathy,123,therapist,Carl Rogers,It damn near made an animal out of you.,1975
Kathy,124,client,Kathy,"Damn near, damn near, yeah. So you see, if uh, I don't want that to happen anymore. At all. Not gonna do it to me again .",1975
Kathy,124,therapist,Carl Rogers,No. That's very clear.,1975
Kathy,125,client,Kathy,"No. I know that doesn't help the other problem, but at least I know that , and I really do know that, you know. Because I don't think anybody has a right to do that to anybody. Nobody ... teacher, wife, husband, whatever. Uh uh, and it, and it really wasn't my fault either and uh, and like I'm not the blameless ... I mean, I'm not without any blame or whatever, but you know, you know ... just like somebody took a big goddamned tree and just rammed it up ... ooh, so, you know? Hard to describe, you know, you know?",1975
Kathy,125,therapist,Carl Rogers,Took a great big stick and rammed it up your ass ... Is that what you're saying?,1975
Kathy,126,client,Kathy,"I, I didn't say that.",1975
Kathy,126,therapist,Carl Rogers,Is that what you meant?,1975
Kathy,127,client,Kathy,That's what I meant.,1975
Kathy,127,therapist,Carl Rogers,"OK. That's what I want to know, whether I was catching your meaning correctly.",1975
Kathy,128,client,Kathy,"Yeah, for sure. You know, and you know that that probably would be painful.",1975
Kathy,128,therapist,Carl Rogers,And it's that kind of pain that you've suffered.,1975
Kathy,129,client,Kathy,"Yeah. . You just can't let it ... I just, I just can't let it happen again. I um really, uh, I just really don't know how to tell you how badly I've been hurt, you know. I really don't.",1975
Kathy,129,therapist,Carl Rogers,Goes beyond words.,1975
Kathy,130,client,Kathy,"Yeah. But I know, you know, it's there, and maybe I should attend to it a little bit more. But, goddammit, you know, just ooh...",1975
Kathy,130,therapist,Carl Rogers,You're feeling some of that hurt now.,1975
Kathy,131,client,Kathy,"Yeah. I am. I was thinking a ... about a wino on a street that continues to drink, doesn't have a place to live. You know I've seen so many people go by, they're the kind of person, you know, disgusting, don't want to work or whatever. But you know, I really feel like there may be some reasons. And I know one thing, I'm gonna allow that person to be desperate ... Because I'm thinking that probably people like that do things out of desperation. And um, 'cause I know, you know? I never really had a drinking problem or anything like that, but it's the kind of sensitivity that I've gotten from all of that.",1975
Kathy,131,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm. It seems, it seems to me that you're uh feeling it ... you know what it's like to be in desperation and you know what it could drag you to, and so maybe that’s what’s happened to some of them. Something like that.",1975
Kathy,132,client,Kathy,"For sure. For sure. And I think that I ... I think my, my heart goes out to people like that, people who can't afford to to do this or whatever, and ... because see, I had a lot of money and you know, it all left. And uh, but in a way I'm happier now, you know. But I really don't know, not sure really where to go next, but I know that I don't really want that kind of life anymore. That I wanna give, I wanna help, and I wanna talk to people or whatever, and before I do that, you know, I wanna get my thing together, and a part of that is just maybe admitting, you know, and I guess maybe admitting that I'm hurt and showing and expressing my hurt or whatever will, will reaffirm the fact that I'm a person Because apart from that, I think showing that is a, you know, pulling myself up too high, you know, and that’s what everybody, you know, that's the way everything was.",1975
Kathy,132,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I don't, I don't feel it ... I don't hurt, I'm, I'm fine""... That’s a lot of bullshit.",1975
Kathy,133,client,Kathy,"For sure. But at least I'm admitting to you that I'm hurt, you know.",1975
Kathy,133,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, that's right, mmm. And just for a moment there, I felt you really were experiencing that too, really feeling that stick shoved up your ass.",1975
Kathy,134,client,Kathy,"Oh, yeah, you know, when I, you know, what is, you know how your natural reaction, you know, when you start feeling stuff like that, or at least when I do, I just kind of, you know, I've got to put it all out of, out of my mind, bring it down to a different level. And I think that's what I'm doing, I keep doing, you know, when I get to the point. Gotta bring it to a safe level.",1975
Kathy,134,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. That's right. You get that close, you get that close to the pit and then pull away a little.",1975
Kathy,135,client,Kathy,"For sure. You, you ... is it all right to have everybody else to blame? You know, for your, for your problem, instead of sharing some of that. But I shared, you know, I, I, I think I've really, I shared that, you know.",1975
Kathy,135,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I think ... I think what you're saying is, ""I feel as though, dammit, everybody else is to blame. My mind says, Oh, no, you have, you probably have a part in it too, but..."" ...your feelings are ...",1975
Kathy,136,client,Kathy,"Yeah, yeah. And I guess I hurt myself. I didn't, other people ... maybe if I can clarify that ... I let myself be hurt. You know, because I just gave too much, you know.",1975
Kathy,136,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Made yourself vulnerable sometimes.,1975
Kathy,137,client,Kathy,Really. And not sometimes ... most of the times.,1975
Kathy,137,therapist,Carl Rogers,Most of the times.,1975
Kathy,138,client,Kathy,"You know, by being, you know, just by being, by sharing, by being there, by giving, you know, and really loving. Because I do have that sense of a total, you know, that just, I wanna love, that's my nature.",1975
Kathy,138,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1975
Kathy,139,client,Kathy,"But you know, I, I've really never been this beaten. I never ... you know, never have.",1975
Kathy,139,therapist,Carl Rogers,I want to be clear about your meaning. You've never felt so much of being beaten as you do right now? Is that what you're saying?,1975
Kathy,140,client,Kathy,"Well, through this whole thing, you know.",1975
Kathy,140,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,141,client,Kathy,"Just beaten, you know, just really beaten, and I think that if I show you how much I've been beaten or whatever, you know, like I'd probably, you know, become nothing in this chair, you know, just ... You know?",1975
Kathy,141,therapist,Carl Rogers,You might practically disappear if you really let me know how hurt and beaten and awful you feel.,1975
Kathy,142,client,Kathy,"Mmm, for sure. For sure. You know, I could tell you some times I mean that would just, you know, maybe blow you away, you know. ... Really too much for me.",1975
Kathy,142,therapist,Carl Rogers,Hmm?,1975
Kathy,143,client,Kathy,It's really too much for me.,1975
Kathy,143,therapist,Carl Rogers,Too much. Mmm.,1975
Kathy,144,client,Kathy,I feel like it.,1975
Kathy,144,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I, I think you feel as though, ""I've gone about as far as I can go at this point"".",1975
Kathy,145,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Mmm, yeah, really. When I start smiling, I know I am.",1975
Kathy,145,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Taking a drink of water.,1975
Kathy,146,client,Kathy,"For sure. Well, you know, but I'm being truthful about it anyway.",1975
Kathy,146,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I feel, I feel too. Uh, you've walked around that pit of hurt and pain and beaten-ness, and you've, you've felt some of it and uh, and perhaps that's as far as you can go right at this moment.",1975
Kathy,147,client,Kathy,Yeah.,1975
Kathy,147,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Even though you know there's more there, you know that you're keeping some of it down. Um and to know those things may be helpful too.",1975
Kathy,148,client,Kathy,"Yeah. You see, because I, I can talk about this leukemia and and all this stuff and everything like that and ... well, I guess it's you know...",1975
Kathy,148,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Fascinating. And it's easier to talk about leukemia and the possibility of death and all that, than it is to talk about all the hurt and awfulness that you've suffered.",1975
Kathy,149,client,Kathy,"Yeah. Whew, oh, I really, whew, a lot, you know . I have to stop. OK?",1975
Kathy,149,therapist,Carl Rogers,"OK. All right, mmm. Gone about as far as you can go.",1975
Kathy,150,client,Kathy,Right.,1975
Kathy,150,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. OK, we'll call it quits. FINAL COMMENT BY ROGERS Here is an armor-plated man. He has been sufficiently hurt that he hides his real feelings very deeply. But in this relationship, the armor begins to crack - just begins to crack. He says, ""This is the first time I've ever talked to anybody that I haven't really been in control"". So in this understanding climate he lets himself creep closer to the experiencing of his feelings. My image is that he is walking all around his own private slough of despond. We find the upper layer is anger, but further down in the slime are the unspeakable hurts, and the feelings of being tramped on, defeated and humiliated. He gets so close to experiencing some of this, that his expressions become eloquent nonverbal communication: ""Ooooh!"" ""Whew! Whew, oh, whew! I've got to stop"". I feel that at that moment he puts his foot into this dreaded pit, but then has to draw back. I don't regret this. I regard it as demonstrating the wisdom of the client. He knows where the worst spots are in his experiencing. He knows what he can tolerate. He has to proceed at his own pace. Along the way we see how powerful metaphor is in the deeper ranges of psychotherapy. Metaphor is so much more expressive than an intellectual description... The lump in his throat... The ability to speak from ""up here"" and not from ""down there""... The goddamn tree stuck up his ass... The green slime that must be vomited... They all speak vividly of his feelings, without naming those feelings. From an intellectual and theoretical point of view there are bits that fascinate me. His introjected self is his cultured self, the quotes ""credit to his race"". It has little relation to the real feelings in which he could discover his real self. Another bit. He reports very convincingly that if he let his feelings all out, it would make him sick again. But hearing those exact words spoken acceptantly by me, makes him realize it's a ridiculous view. To me that's a fascinating interchange. Here’s another bit. When I give him full permission to be as angry as he wishes, that stops him completely. Then he can no longer avoid the fact that it is not his anger that he is afraid of, but the hurting and vulnerable part of him. Then there is the mourning which accompanies unexpressed love, the love for his father-in-law which he was never able to communicate. I think he gained from communicating it to me. Finally, he makes it very clear that for him there are many more frightening aspects of his life than the prospect of death. Somehow this seems to contain a message for all of us. As for me, I felt very present in the relationship, an understanding companion on this trip of exploration which seemed so potentially dangerous to him. I think it is a good example of how I work with an articulate client.",1975
