Dione_2nd,1,therapist,Carl Rogers,O.K. Where do you want to start this morning?,1977
Dione_2nd,2,client,Dione,"Uh, I don't know. I wa ... I was thinking that when we ... when we talked earlier about the, the anger ... I've been thinking a great deal about that.",1977
Dione_2nd,2,therapist,Carl Rogers,I've thought a lot about what you had to say about that.,1977
Dione_2nd,3,client,Dione,"Right, you know, and I'm not sure that, uh, that I really don't want to be angry, you know, and I'm not sure if anger ... being angry now, is a part of the process and I've got to do that, but I'd like to ... I guess my uh ... I guess my mind uh academically or something, you know, and something other than emotion or whatever, like, would like to tell me that, uh, I'd like to uh ... to not be angry and to skip over that part, if that's a part of the process, you know? But I'm not sure I can do that , you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,3,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Your mind says sort of, ""Oh, cool it. Don't ... don't get into uh, such strong emo- tion"".",1977
Dione_2nd,4,client,Dione,"For sure. It almost seems like that ... that uh whatever is happening in my environment or whatever happened in my environment is pulling me into again uh, that kind of a trap ... that kind of a system that I don't particularly care ... er, er, you know, if you know what I mean.",1977
Dione_2nd,4,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. I think I get that: that your ... your mind is taking the place of the system in saying now, uh, ""Play it right. Do the right ... do the proper thing"".",1977
Dione_2nd,5,client,Dione,Right.,1977
Dione_2nd,5,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But some other part of you is saying, ""Yeah, but there's some anger there"".",1977
Dione_2nd,6,client,Dione,For sure. For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,6,therapist,Carl Rogers,There's some real anger there.,1977
Dione_2nd,7,client,Dione,"Right. It's ... it's almost like in this country ... and, and I've always felt like this ... you only have about two options, you know, when you deal with race ... you either have to be ... you're either a racist or you're an anti-racist. And that doesn't really seem to be the kind of thing that I'm, you know .... I don't really care to be an anti-racist, if you know what I mean anymore. Uh, and I don't wanna be a reflection of any other ... of any other larger society at all. I really don't want to ...",1977
Dione_2nd,7,therapist,Carl Rogers,You'd like to get in touch with what's going on in you.,1977
Dione_2nd,8,client,Dione,For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,8,therapist,Carl Rogers,Not ... not some label or other.,1977
Dione_2nd,9,client,Dione,"For sure. I think that I could probably trust that a lot better than, than, than trusting what's happening or what has happened. And, um, and when I think about that ... when I think about all of that, you know, uh, the things that we talked about ... I, I, I think that, um, that's worse than the leukemia.",1977
Dione_2nd,9,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Uh, uh-huh.",1977
Dione_2nd,10,client,Dione,"You know? I know that may sound very strange or whatever, but a lot of things have been strange",1977
Dione_2nd,10,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,11,client,Dione,"You know, since this time; and, and what has happened to me didn't just start when I found out that I, you know, was going to die. Kind of thing.",1977
Dione_2nd,11,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Let me see if I understand that. That you feel as though, um, what the culture and people and so on have ... have done to you ... that's really caused you more suffering than the leukemia. Is that what you're saying?",1977
Dione_2nd,12,client,Dione,"I think so. I think so. And to some extent that ... that would ... that is mild ... like, for instance, you know, you ... I don't know what would have happened if I had died or if I will or whatever, but I certainly know what's happening now and what happened.",1977
Dione_2nd,12,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,13,client,Dione,You see.,1977
Dione_2nd,13,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,14,client,Dione,"And to some extent that ... that kind of leukemia, that kind of deterioration of the body is the same kind of thing that happened to my mind. And um ... You know, it’s ...",1977
Dione_2nd,14,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So really, what the culture did to you was give you a cancer of the mind.",1977
Dione_2nd,15,client,Dione,"Yeah. I, I, I, I really ... I think, I really want to say that and I really want to, um, and I believe it, you know, and I guess that part of me that's, that's my culture or is a part of the total, ... is saying that it's not all that good to be angry, you know, because militancy is frowned upon or whatever, you know. And I guess I'm using mili- militant in my sense because of ... it's, it's just traditionally, you know, when blacks become angry they're, they're not angry ... they're militant. You know what I mean ?",1977
Dione_2nd,15,therapist,Carl Rogers,I know. Another label.,1977
Dione_2nd,16,client,Dione,"Mmm. For sure, for sure, for sure. Yeah. And I ... and there's nobody that I can put my finger on, you know ... that person that started the whole thing ... that process, you know, because that would probably be a lot better for me, you know, then I probably would, would try to, to do ... to do that person in.",1977
Dione_2nd,16,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah ... If you could ... If you could pin it on one person, then your rage would be justified and you could really get after that person.",1977
Dione_2nd,17,client,Dione,"Mmm. But how, you know ... but how do you blame somebody else who's sick? You know? And I think that people that do that to other people, or at least - when it was done to me, um ... they're really sick, you know. And here I am, you know, trying to ... you know, I don't know if it was forgiving, I don't know if I'm sounding confused or whatever, maybe, you know, but trying to accept their sickness, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,17,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,18,client,Dione,"And at the same time, you know, I really haven't had the opportunity of letting anybody accept mine.",1977
Dione_2nd,18,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,19,client,Dione,"Or maybe I haven't given it to them, but ...",1977
Dione_2nd,19,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, maybe you haven't given it to them.",1977
Dione_2nd,20,client,Dione,Right.,1977
Dione_2nd,20,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That's what I sense is going on now ... that you feel ""there's so many reasons why I really shouldn't express my anger. I'll, I'll talk about all those reasons"".",1977
Dione_2nd,21,client,Dione,"Yeah , for sure. I don't know really, you know. Maybe I'll just be angry one day and maybe I'll really feel better or whatever, you know, and, and I ... when I, when I smile, I ... I'm uh, you know, I'm smiling but there’s a lot of ... and I'm sure you know that ... there's a lot of anger there. You know, but it's not my nature to be angry It's not my nature to be angry, but I feel angry.",1977
Dione_2nd,21,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. Um, and uh so I hear you explaining and explaining that uh, uh, ""that's not my nature to be angry. It's just that I am angry right now"".",1977
Dione_2nd,22,client,Dione,"For sure , for sure. And to try to be angry in a productive ... I don't know how you'd be angry in a productive way ... you know, in terms of ... It's like now when I ... when I respond to people, you know ... if, if when you encounter people, you know, whether it's in the street, whether it's in a professional situation or whatever, you know ...if people send out certain messages and wh ... no matter what they're saying or whatever ... there are certain kinds of messages that I'm getting, you know. They're saying that, ""hey, you know ... that isn't for me"" kind of thing, you know. And that's before, you know, I'd like to work with that, and ride it ... like to try to communicate without alienating ... people or whatever, but now, you know, I'm ending up saying, you know, like ...""hey, that's a bunch of crap"", you know. ""Don't ... don't, don't tell me about the way that I should do it or, or give me all that nonverbal stuff about, um, you saying that I'm OK, but by nonver- bally saying ... ""hey"", you know, ""you're really not OK"", you know. And I don't want to hear that kind of stuff anymore.",1977
Dione_2nd,22,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I get what you're saying and I also feel quite strongly that I want to say, ""it's OK with me if you're angry here""...",1977
Dione_2nd,23,client,Dione,"... But I don't, you know ... it's hard to know how to be angry, you know ... hard to ...",1977
Dione_2nd,23,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sure, sure, I'm not saying you have to be. . I'm just saying it's OK with me.",1977
Dione_2nd,24,client,Dione,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,24,therapist,Carl Rogers,"If you feel like being angry, you can be angry.",1977
Dione_2nd,25,client,Dione,You really believe that?,1977
Dione_2nd,25,therapist,Carl Rogers,Damn right.,1977
Dione_2nd,26,client,Dione,"Well. I'm not sure how to respond to that at all, you know, because a part of that anger is, you know, the ... the hurt, and maybe if I’m... maybe what's happening is that if I'm ... if I become angry and I really let it hang out, that I really will see how hurt I am.",1977
Dione_2nd,26,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,27,client,Dione,"And um, you know, that just came to me as you were talking.",1977
Dione_2nd,27,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,28,client,Dione,"That, you know ...",1977
Dione_2nd,28,therapist,Carl Rogers,Perhaps at a deeper level you're afraid of the hurt that you may experience if you let yourself experience the anger.,1977
Dione_2nd,29,client,Dione,For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,29,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,30,client,Dione,Really.,1977
Dione_2nd,30,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,31,client,Dione,"Um, whew ... I keep getting these blocks, you know ... these, you know ... when I come to something like that, you know, because, you know, to me that's a revelation and I'm not really sure that, uh, risking being angry I guess ... or something like that, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,31,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,32,client,Dione,"Losing control, maybe.",1977
Dione_2nd,32,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,33,client,Dione,You know? Well ... .,1977
Dione_2nd,33,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I really do get that ... that this ... this realization that, ""Maybe what I'm most afraid of is the hurt that I might experience"", um, makes you more cautious about whether you should, whether you should or could really let go of the ... of the anger.",1977
Dione_2nd,34,client,Dione,"I really don't know, I think that ...",1977
Dione_2nd,34,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's a risk.,1977
Dione_2nd,35,client,Dione,"Right. And it's, you know ... I hadn't really thought about that before.",1977
Dione_2nd,35,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. It's new.,1977
Dione_2nd,36,client,Dione,"Yeah. It's, uh ... I guess I would be ... and I'd re-really would admit openly that I'm hurt. I, I said that I've been hurt.",1977
Dione_2nd,36,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,37,client,Dione,"And I think, you know, that I, I feel I've been hurt, but to really ... to show that, you know ...",1977
Dione_2nd,37,therapist,Carl Rogers,"To show it and ... I guess to let yourself sort of ... experience it, that ... that, I guess would be difficult.",1977
Dione_2nd,38,client,Dione,"Yeah, I, I don't know. It ... it's, it, it's as scary, I think, as the possibility of ... that I had before ... more than before, about dying, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,38,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,39,client,Dione,"And maybe, you know ... guess I was really scared because of the symptoms, you know, of, of, you know ... not being able to walk and not being able to see, and things like that, you know. And having to depend on somebody, you know. And for God's sake, you know ... having to show somebody that I'm ... that I'm hurt. And how, you know, how can I trust that to somebody, you know. Umm ...",1977
Dione_2nd,39,therapist,Carl Rogers,Seems like a horribly big risk.,1977
Dione_2nd,40,client,Dione,"Yeah, it is . Seems to be getting bigger and bigger as we talk!",1977
Dione_2nd,40,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. ""Suppose I really expose to somebody the fact that I'm deeply, deeply hurt"". That in a sense would be comparable to having to be dependent on someone when you can't walk or something like that.",1977
Dione_2nd,41,client,Dione,"Right. Yeah. I'd like to just to say it's my ... it’s trying my conditioning. I try not to ... one way out of it ... and, uh ... But that ... that isn't really acceptable to me now because I ... I, I, I, I feel that I ... I feel like ... that I have to express that, that hurt or whatever, but you know, I can say that, you know, and I know right down here, you know, I'm ... I'm saying that and when I say it, you know, it kind of keeps something down here. , you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,41,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. You're saying it from here up. .,1977
Dione_2nd,42,client,Dione,"For sure. For sure . I don't know how to do that exactly ... whatever ... It's like I don't drink a lot, you know, because I don't really want to, uh ... ... experience that kind of, uh, you know ... alcohol to me is a depressant anyway, and um, you know ... that's about the only thing I really like to get out ... to really get out, you know, and maybe saying, you know, like I'll love somebody. ""I gave of myself"". I did the ... hell ... the best I could, and it wasn't good enough, you know, and you know, demand on top of demand and everything like that, you know ... It's just, you know ... Shit ... you know, it's, it's like that I'd like to be able uhh ... and I said this here, the other day or when I was talking to you ... that I'd like to be able to, to say that ... yeah, ""I was screwed over and I got hurt and everything else"", like that, or whatever, but it's an ... it's almost an admission in a, in a way on another level of, of ... of saying that they got the best of me, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,42,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,43,client,Dione,And I really don' want ...,1977
Dione_2nd,43,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,44,client,Dione,"You know, I really don't want anybody historically to get, have ... to have gotten the best of me ... but they did. They did. They beat the hell out of me.",1977
Dione_2nd,44,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You don't want to say, ""I really was defeated at times"", and yet that's the truth.",1977
Dione_2nd,45,client,Dione,"Mmm. It is. You know, being ... having it being all right to be defeated and be beaten and I don't know if there's any value in, you know ... maybe to myself ... admitting it to myself, or whatever, you know, but you know, I ... I'm really finding out I got a lot of , hangups in terms of, in that line that I hadn't thought of before, you know ... in terms of, you know, because I don't want to be beaten. But I was, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,45,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,46,client,Dione,"Because I think when you are hurt, that's being beaten except, you know ...",1977
Dione_2nd,46,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,47,client,Dione,"And I allowed myself to, and I don't regret caring, and I don't regret loving or whatever, but you know ... like I'm a ... I'm a kid, you know, I'm a kid in a way. I like to be loved too; I like to be uh ... ... some reciprocity. And I'm going to start, I think, expecting that. You know ... without being cold or anything like that. But I have to, you know, start getting something back in return.",1977
Dione_2nd,47,therapist,Carl Rogers,You want love to be mutual.,1977
Dione_2nd,48,client,Dione,"For sure, for sure. And I don't want to have, uh get in the situation like I'm in now, you know, where I'm afraid to, to, to, show anybody that I am, I'm hurt, you know. Scared to death ... terrified.",1977
Dione_2nd,48,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Something really awful about showing ... letting anyone know that ""I'm hurt"". ""I'm hurting"".",1977
Dione_2nd,49,client,Dione,"Sure, sure. It's, you know ... it has something to do with being a man and it has something to do with ... with the race thing, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,49,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,50,client,Dione,It has something to do with the relationship ...,1977
Dione_2nd,50,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,51,client,Dione,"Maybe the failure of a relationship, uh. A ... a lot of things, you know ... a father not being in the home with his children.",1977
Dione_2nd,51,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,52,client,Dione,"You know, I really feel like being a victim.",1977
Dione_2nd,52,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,53,client,Dione,"I don't know how to get that up at all. Every time I get close to that, I take a drink of water! Uh, I don't know if that acts to keep it down there or what.",1977
Dione_2nd,53,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Maybe ... maybe, maybe that'll keep it from coming up above this level .",1977
Dione_2nd,54,client,Dione,"For sure. I, I don't know. See, how it, it really isn't what I want either. You know, I want it to get out and stay out, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,54,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I would like to let it out"".",1977
Dione_2nd,55,client,Dione,"Yeah. So maybe if you have any exorcism type powers or whatever, that, uh ... maybe you can just do that and then I'll be free of that, you know. Because that's what it feels like ... it feels like there's something there, you know, that I really ... and I've identified it. I think I've identified it, you know, because I know there're some times when there’s such a big lump in my throat, you know, and that I explain, I give myself a lot of reasons why I shouldn't be feeling like that, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,55,therapist,Carl Rogers,"A big lump of hurt, though. And how to let that hurt come out in the open ... how to let it ... emerge and be out here instead of way down locked in here.",1977
Dione_2nd,56,client,Dione,"Right. Yeah. You know, I, I, I never believe in cookbook answers to anything, even when I cook I don't use a cookbook. I just don't believe in it. I think, but I'd really like to be able for somebody to tell me to, you know, maybe how to do that in about five minutes and be through with it so I can live the rest of my life in peace. You know what I mean?",1977
Dione_2nd,56,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sure. It'd be awfully nice if somebody could say, ""Now, if you do this and this, all your hurt will come out and it will be gone forever"".",1977
Dione_2nd,57,client,Dione,For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,57,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Be great, wouldn't it?",1977
Dione_2nd,58,client,Dione,For sure. I have a suspicion that maybe you know some things that I don't know.,1977
Dione_2nd,58,therapist,Carl Rogers,No.,1977
Dione_2nd,59,client,Dione,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,59,therapist,Carl Rogers,"No, I'm not holding out on you.",1977
Dione_2nd,60,client,Dione,"Hey, I, I believe that. I, I ... it feels like I'm holding out on myself ... You know. But hell, you know. I don't know.",1977
Dione_2nd,60,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I think it goes back to some of the things you mentioned. A man doesn't admit he's hurt ... a black man especially doesn't admit that he's been hurt by anything. Uh, a father doesn't admit he's been hurt by being away from his children. Just too many things that say: no, no, no ... don't let it out. But inside there's the hurt.",1977
Dione_2nd,61,client,Dione,Yeah.,1977
Dione_2nd,61,therapist,Carl Rogers,"A phrase came to me a minute ago that, “If you could let that out, ...” I don't know whether this will ring true to you or not ... “If you could let that out, it would be the Voice of a Victim.” I don't know if that makes any sense or not.",1977
Dione_2nd,62,client,Dione,"Mmm, yeah. And I don't know what, you know, I don't know if I have any control over that, you know, of what, of what ... of what would happen, you know. It's like a friend of mine the other day, who helped me through my illness and everything, he says, you know, when I've encountered another person that, you know, a very intelligent sort that was talking a bunch of intellectual garbage about feelings and things like that ... that I really wa ... wanted to just, to, you know, I really saw the ... him ... the society, the culture, right in him, you know. And I really wanted to just ... to kind of deck him, you know, and that's something that's not uh my nature whatever, but I could just really wonder that ...",1977
Dione_2nd,62,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, just like to have socked him.",1977
Dione_2nd,63,client,Dione,"Yeah, yeah. And my friend said, you know, ""one of these days"", he says, if you ... ""if you don't get it together"" or, or something, he says ... not ""that if you don't get it together"", but he says, ""one of these days you're gonna really lose it, you know"". You know what I mean? It ... it's that I want to get rid of all that stuff that was done to me and not have to hear all that other stuff, or to be able to deal with it in a very constructive kind of a way, you know. But still it grinds me because of all the other stuff that's happened to me. And when I see other people doing it to other people, or whatever, it grinds me ... it makes me angry, you know? And I would think that in those situations, I've begun to kind of strike out, you know, or like you know, protecting somebody else or fighting for somebody else or whatever, and like I'm not sure what I did for myself, though, over those years that all that happened to me or whatever. Annnd, if I could cry and have it be all right...",1977
Dione_2nd,63,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That's what I was thinking. I was just thinking, if you could only cry.",1977
Dione_2nd,64,client,Dione,"Yeah. It would, you know, but that's, that's a trip, you know ... that's a trip like uh...",1977
Dione_2nd,64,therapist,Carl Rogers,"First place, a man doesn't cry.",1977
Dione_2nd,65,client,Dione,"Yeah. For sure, for sure. That's a fact.",1977
Dione_2nd,65,therapist,Carl Rogers,But I guess you're saying that times you have that lump in your throat and you sure as hell feel like crying.,1977
Dione_2nd,66,client,Dione,"For sure, for sure. Uhh, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe going to a movie or one of those old, you know, movies, dramas, or something like that ...",1977
Dione_2nd,66,therapist,Carl Rogers,Tear jerkers?,1977
Dione_2nd,67,client,Dione,"Right ... so I can cry, you know, and have an excuse to cry, you know, but crying for myself, I'm not sure that, uh ... I'm just not sure that's going to be constructive, you know .",1977
Dione_2nd,67,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, you say you're not sure whether crying for yourself is constructive. I feel also you're afraid of crying for yourself.",1977
Dione_2nd,68,client,Dione,"I may be, I may be, because if I feel like crying and I don't, whenever there's some things that are, you know ... but you see, that's a part of it too, you know? It's ... you know, and I, and I can't ... I, I hate to keep using these things of, you know, we're just being so conditioned not to, you know, from a little thing of, you know, like oh, you know, ""be little, little men or big boys"", or whatever. ""Don't cry"", and, and ...",1977
Dione_2nd,68,therapist,Carl Rogers,Probably your seven-year-old could cry.,1977
Dione_2nd,69,client,Dione,"Yeah, for sure. I cried, I remember crying, but I cried alone. I never let anybody see me cry, you know? I wonder how many people have seen me cry! Two or three in the whole world. It's kind of interesting, you know. I remember living with my ex-wife, or whatever, she cried all the time. She cried get- ting up in the morning, and you know, just crying for crying, you know. I asked her sometimes about why she cried, and she just said, ""I don't know, just wanted to, felt good"". I don't know if that was healthy or whatever, but it probably is a lot more healthier than what I did.",1977
Dione_2nd,69,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. It probably is better than never letting anyone see you cry.,1977
Dione_2nd,70,client,Dione,"Right. There's just so many other ways to do it, you know, that I've learned, you know, like working hard. Not thinking about it, you know. Not thinking about it.",1977
Dione_2nd,70,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Just seeing that all the sorrow that you feel for yourself and for what's happened to you and all that, uh, ""that doesn't really exist"". It's just uh, you're too busy to have any thoughts of that.",1977
Dione_2nd,71,client,Dione,For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,71,therapist,Carl Rogers,But the sorrow is still there.,1977
Dione_2nd,72,client,Dione,"For sure. Yeah. And I really don't know how to de ... and I really don't know how to deal with that. I really don't. I really don't. You know, just really giving so much of yourself and it's really crazy. Too much. .",1977
Dione_2nd,72,therapist,Carl Rogers,"If you did cry, what would some of the themes of that crying be?",1977
Dione_2nd,73,client,Dione,"Well, just you know, all those, you know, hours that I, you know, that I spent away from my family and that I gave up my family and didn't see my children grow, you know. I really wanted that to be for some kind of a higher level, some kind of a cause, you know. But not to have that uh, to see anything, any benefit that I did. You know, all of that work, I mean, hours and hours and ... but it's just incredible, and I think that would be one, you know, I was saying, ""Damn it, why in the hell did I spend so much time?"" ""Why did I spend so much time?"". You know, the leukemia, the ... everything that happened to me or whatever would be properly deserved if one person's life would have been changed, or something, you know. And like, and maybe, maybe it has or whatever, but, but I think that I, I don't trust that ... that it was worth it, you see?",1977
Dione_2nd,73,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. Yeah. You invested a whole lot of caring, a whole lot of your self, and you feel real sorrow that maybe nothing came of that.",1977
Dione_2nd,74,client,Dione,"Yeah, and I'd also like to uh just kind of cry for my father-in-law too, who was killed before I ... about six months before I got the leukemia. I'd like to really tell him that I uh, that I really loved him a great deal.",1977
Dione_2nd,74,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm ... So you're telling me in place of telling him and maybe you could even speak to him, I don't know. But at any rate, you really would like to tell him, ""I loved you, you know that? I loved you"".",1977
Dione_2nd,75,client,Dione,"Well, I, I really would, you know. Th-thisss situation that we started out ... I was married, and we married somebody of a different race, and we fought it out tooth and nail or whatever, and but, but yet we loved each other and we fished together and he was great with me. You know, he had a very ... to other people, a very cold way, you know, of, you know, ""By God, this is the way it's going to be"" and so forth. But I saw him when he was hurt too, and um when he was killed in, in 1975, in a, in a hunting accident, it just really took all of it, you know. Because you see, he helped me to, to try to get out of that stuff. He's saying, ""Hey, what are you doing, you know? Do ... what do you really want to do?"". And at the time I wanted to, you know, to open my own restaurant or whatever. And so he was going to help me finance that restaurant, you know. And so a week later he was killed. One week. And um, and so we were getting so close, but that I really never told him that, ""Hey Dad, you know, hey Dad, I love you, I really love you"". And we told each other, I guess, in some ways or whatever, but it's not the same as saying it, you know, as saying, ""Dad, I really love you. I really care"".",1977
Dione_2nd,75,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You feel really sad that you never gave him a straight message on that, that ""I love you"".",1977
Dione_2nd,76,client,Dione,"For sure, for sure, because he was straighter th ... with me than a lot of people, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,76,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,77,client,Dione,"And to now to be taken away from all of that, you see, because it's only been, I don't know, eight months or so since I ceased all communication with my family, you know, family that ... my wife's family that I've loved and I've cared for and that I buried my father-in-law and that was it. That was the ... and then even the family began to take on those same things of the culture, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,77,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Things began to fall apart for you there, mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,78,client,Dione,"For sure, for sure, you know. And lately, I don't know, falling apart or at least my being able to see that uh that it really wasn't, it wasn't true. It wasn't real, I wasn't getting, I wasn't getting anything back, I wasn't getting any nourishment back, you know. Smiles and polite kisses and things like that, you know. That is, you know, part of the hurt, you know. I'd rather for somebody to say, you know, ""I think you're a lousy S.O.B. or whatever"", as opposed to saying, ""Hello, dear, how are you?"" You know, you know?.",1977
Dione_2nd,78,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. When the real message perhaps is, ""I think you're a lousy S.O.B."".",1977
Dione_2nd,79,client,Dione,"Right, right, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,79,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,80,client,Dione,". Yeah, so there's, you know, there's a few things.",1977
Dione_2nd,80,therapist,Carl Rogers,Part of the sorrow would be for your father-in-law. You'd really weep for him.,1977
Dione_2nd,81,client,Dione,"I ... yeah, I think I would, you know. And just maybe I still think that I really wish that I could, you know, just say, ""Hey, you know, you guys, you really don't realize what you did to me"", you know? Because for a while, I just, you know, saying, well, you know, ""racist"", ""terrible"", ""blah, blah, blah"". But that doesn't say anything, you know, because it doesn't say how I really feel, you know. But they, but it, but it ... they wouldn't understand that, they wouldn't understand how a black person could be hurt, you know, because if you don't accept a person as human, how can you, how can you think about, you know, like ... it's like thinking a dog could be hurt of whatever, you know, people that don't have dogs and don't understand them, you know?",1977
Dione_2nd,81,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But you get some satisfaction out of saying, ""You people don't realize how much you hurt me"". They might not be able to hear that message, but you'd get some satisfaction out of ... out of expressing that, out of ... out of letting, letting yourself know, letting others know that, ""God, I've been hurt!""",1977
Dione_2nd,82,client,Dione,Yeah.,1977
Dione_2nd,82,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I've been wounded"".",1977
Dione_2nd,83,client,Dione,"I just don't think I could do that 'cause I just don't think that that that, I just don't trust, you know, you know, I wouldn't do it because I just wouldn't want to give them the satisfaction, you know. It's like I feel like, you know, my saying, you know, ""Maybe that is my feeling"". But I, I have too many times, you know, when you know, I opened up a little bit or whatever, and someone says ... ... you know, squash!",1977
Dione_2nd,83,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So there are probably loads of people you wouldn't dare open up to on that, but I guess you're opening up to me to say, ""Yes, but I have been really wounded, badly, by a lot of people"".",1977
Dione_2nd,84,client,Dione,"For sure. Mmm. I maybe think that you can understand that a little bit in terms of about hurt and that, you know, that ... you know, that I, you know, that I'm a person and uh, you know, I'm a person. And I don't really want that denied to me ... you know, ever again.",1977
Dione_2nd,84,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,85,client,Dione,You know. I could really get angry.,1977
Dione_2nd,85,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,86,client,Dione,"I don't you know, I just ... that's not going to happen to me, you know. In a way, you know, I don't want to love anybody like I did my father-in-law again, and for God's sake, you know, that's, that's painful, but I know that's terribly sick too, that you have to love, you have to continue to love people. Or whatever. But at that time, it was the only thing that was productive. It was the only thing that was something that was, you know, as Fromm talks about, biophilic. It was growth; it was nourishing. And that was the only thing, and that was just taken away from me, and it was taken away from me just ...",1977
Dione_2nd,86,therapist,Carl Rogers,Just like that.,1977
Dione_2nd,87,client,Dione,"You know, It was just really strange, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,87,therapist,Carl Rogers,"So that, that's been a ... a hurt and a shock and makes you feel, ""I can't risk myself loving somebody else like that because that might disappear some way or other"".",1977
Dione_2nd,88,client,Dione,"For sure, for sure. For sure. I certainly don't want any more in-laws. . Be they uh whatever color. I'm not sure I want them, but now you know ... And that's ... I think that's part of it, you know. More so than, than the risking loving somebody, just because their death ... death I know is inevitable. But it's that, that other collection of things around it, or whatever. But you know, it's... it’s crazy.",1977
Dione_2nd,88,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's what?,1977
Dione_2nd,89,client,Dione,"It's crazy to love, you know, it's just like loving a pet rock or something, you know, it's nothing. Nothing, you don't feel.",1977
Dione_2nd,89,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. mmm. ""Love goes out from me but nothing comes back"".",1977
Dione_2nd,90,client,Dione,"Right. And I'm not so sure that that, that I want that, it to work like that again, you know. And maybe by ... maybe saying that, I don't know, maybe you know, calling, say, ""Hey, I really was hurt"" and everything like that or whatever. Maybe that would be a start or whatever, but I just don't really trust that they really understand that. I don't really, really uh ... it took my wife who lived with me for seven years, you know, after I left, maybe six, seven months to understand that I was, that I was hurt, that I was ... that I was desperate.",1977
Dione_2nd,90,therapist,Carl Rogers,You feel there's so little chance of anyone else really understanding you.,1977
Dione_2nd,91,client,Dione,"Mmm, that sounds kind of, yeah, well, , so little chance for that group of people understanding me. And I believe it. I really believe it, you know. It would just, it would be like me trying to, uh, to understand or to, to tell Dick Nixon or something about my feelings, that I just don't think he could relate to that,you know. And I'm using, and ... and I'm really serious about that example, because he's so far away from me and my reality, and that family, you know, I found out was so far away from me and my reality that, you know, it was insane, you know. It was really insane, you know. So I think on one level I feel OK for loving them.",1977
Dione_2nd,91,therapist,Carl Rogers,You feel...?,1977
Dione_2nd,92,client,Dione,OK for loving them.,1977
Dione_2nd,92,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I see, mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,93,client,Dione,"But I don't feel OK for sharing any more with them. And sharing that hurt is just, you know ... and maybe sharing it with other people would be OK. But I know I'm moving away from the other too, you know, that's really important to me right now. And I don't know ... maybe I won't ... I'm not rushing it, it just seems to want to get out and jump out or whatever, but, you know, you know. It's clearly must have really gone through ... my body really must have gone through some changes or whatever because, you know, something there is just keeping it, keeping it down, and I know all those reasons but I can't uh, I can't seem to muster that power to ... ... to get it, to get that out, you know, to really, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,93,therapist,Carl Rogers,It's still too much locked in.,1977
Dione_2nd,94,client,Dione,"Yeah, for sure. But it really, it really helps, you know, um, 'cause it's, it's, it's just, you know ... it's incredible, you know, this is the first time I've talked to anybody that, you know, that I haven't really been in control. To some extent I've really given up a lot of control uh ... to you.",1977
Dione_2nd,94,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm, sort of letting things loose rather than ... ... keeping them under your control.",1977
Dione_2nd,95,client,Dione,For sure.,1977
Dione_2nd,95,therapist,Carl Rogers,And that's a new experience.,1977
Dione_2nd,96,client,Dione,"A very new experience for me. Very new experience. And maybe I don't know if it's just not, just it's a function, function of that too, you know, or something, you know. Things are rattling around in my head now , you know. But all the other, it's just bullshit, and like I have been hurt and I really don't want to get involved anymore in terms of with people that can't return love and can't accept people. I just don't really want to get involved anymore. I'm sick and tired ... sick of it.",1977
Dione_2nd,96,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Sounds as though you're more accepting of yourself as a person who is vulnerable, who has been hurt, who is hurting, and who wants love ... who doesn't want it all to be a one-way street of giving love. You want love back in return.",1977
Dione_2nd,97,client,Dione,"Mmm, mmm. Yeah. And I wanna be able to uh, to feel and to, and to cry. And not to be afraid of crying, and, and not to be afraid of, uh ... I want to be able and I'm going to work for that. I really wanna work for that. I, I know I do, you know, I just have this thing, ah, you know. If I trust the doctors, I'd have them cut 'em, cut me open and get that out, you know, but I don't.",1977
Dione_2nd,97,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Probably'd be simpler to have an operation.,1977
Dione_2nd,98,client,Dione,"Oh yeah! . Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I, but do you, do you, do you, do you, do you feel that ... you know, like I really wanna, you know, tell you how hurt I am, but I'm not, I can't tell you?",1977
Dione_2nd,98,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I understand that. I ... you're, you're uh, it visualizes in my mind you're walking all around the edge of that pit, but you're not really letting yourself down into it; so you're letting me know all about it , but, but not it.",1977
Dione_2nd,99,client,Dione,Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Don't know how to do that. You know?,1977
Dione_2nd,99,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. I, I hear you saying, ""I really want to get to that, but it will have to be at my pace. I can't ... I can't force it. I can't... but I do want to get to it"".",1977
Dione_2nd,100,client,Dione,"Yeah. 'Cause I want to get to it really fast, you know, because that's all a part of me right now that's really ... I really feel that's sick, that's really the cancer, you know. That if I could eliminate that, I could eliminate all the cancer from my body. I really believe it, you know. And I really blame, I really blame the way I lived and the stress and everything else like that on, on on the disease. I really do.",1977
Dione_2nd,100,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You mean, you blame the disease on all that stress, is what you mean?",1977
Dione_2nd,101,client,Dione,"Right, for sure, yeah. I have it turned around. For sure. I do. I do. And to some extent, I blame racism. You know, I just don't want to get caught up into that anymore, you know, and I want to continue to give, but I don't, I, I, I'm just not going to do it the way I did it before. And uh, I don't know. May ... yelling sometimes you know, like when I came in here, I was thinking about yelling, you know, one of those long, big long ... you know. But I'm not sure that I want to do that.",1977
Dione_2nd,101,therapist,Carl Rogers,You could try it.,1977
Dione_2nd,102,client,Dione,"You know, I don't know, you know That wouldn't be cultured.",1977
Dione_2nd,102,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Standards, standards, standards.",1977
Dione_2nd,103,client,Dione,"Sure, I mean, I'm really, I was really socialized.",1977
Dione_2nd,103,therapist,Carl Rogers,You were brought up right ... weren't you?,1977
Dione_2nd,104,client,Dione,"Oh yeah, I was. I learned all of it ... all of it.",1977
Dione_2nd,104,therapist,Carl Rogers,"And still in spite of yourself, buy a good deal of it.",1977
Dione_2nd,105,client,Dione,Yeah. Yeah.,1977
Dione_2nd,105,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You really don't want to, but still you find ... ... you can't do the uncultu- red thing.",1977
Dione_2nd,106,client,Dione,"For sure. There were standards, I guess, and uh, that are really foreign to me, but uh, you know, the, the thing that, you know ... that I thought about you know, and like you know, I was like in terms of expressing my anger, whatever, comes out in terms of, you know , possible obscenity, you know , you know, like calling somebody a bunch of something or whatever would really, you know, I don't know what it would do, but you know, I'd really like to do that, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,106,therapist,Carl Rogers,"That helps to explain why I feel you've kept your language more, quite guarded here. I, I, I realize I've used more profanity than you have.",1977
Dione_2nd,107,client,Dione,"For sure, you know. It's not because of, you know, but I don't know, it's just a, a part of that, you know, like I was just ...",1977
Dione_2nd,107,therapist,Carl Rogers,You'd like to just tell off the bastard!,1977
Dione_2nd,108,client,Dione,"Yeah, right, right, right. For sure. Oh my goodness!",1977
Dione_2nd,108,therapist,Carl Rogers,You can't even do that.,1977
Dione_2nd,109,client,Dione,"Oh, it's incredible. I don't know. Whew! I'm getting warm.",1977
Dione_2nd,109,therapist,Carl Rogers,Both inside and outside,1977
Dione_2nd,110,client,Dione,"Yes, right, right. I'm getting extremely warm. Um, yeah, maybe I'll be able to do it one day, I guess. Maybe I'll be able to do it . I really haven't used ... but see, when I get out of here, I'll use a lot of profanity, you know. I don't, you know, just in terms of, you know, like I ... I, I, I, I think I did, you know, when I was really angry talking to my wife and things like that, you know, where I was just, ""Goddammit"", and all of that, you know, ""bastards"" and some other things and like, you know, I was raised properly, you know . Uh, yeah, but I think part of that would be a part of expressing my feelings and everything like that, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,110,therapist,Carl Rogers,"It wouldn't come out in nice, polite language.",1977
Dione_2nd,111,client,Dione,"No, it wouldn't. It, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't. To my teachers that I had, to the family that I had, uh, to a lot of my colleagues, you know, and others. And ... but I don't know if I really want to tell them, you know, maybe it's just a part of just being proud and, and everything else like that, but at least to myself I, I need to get it out and openly.",1977
Dione_2nd,111,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. You may not tell it to them face to face, but you need to get it out of yourself somehow.",1977
Dione_2nd,112,client,Dione,"Mmm. Somehow, yeah, yeah. Really rotten and I really feel s ... you know, really screwed. I really feel ... ... so badly.",1977
Dione_2nd,112,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""The bastards really screwed me"".",1977
Dione_2nd,113,client,Dione,"Yeah, I know. They ... they got me, you know. It was just like uh, being part, I guess, that had something to do with being in, you know, I guess, you know, I just ... I just wipe 'em out, you know, if you don't get them with their bodies you do it in their mind, you know, like it happened, you know, and it was ... it was real, you know, and you know, to try to describe that hell to somebody is just the, the hardest thing, you know. But it's like, you know, just somebody knocking you down ... ... and it's somebody coming and stomping on you and spitting on you and everything like that, and like it's just, you know, and just being at ... feeling like garbage.",1977
Dione_2nd,113,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,114,client,Dione,"And I have the feeling that people have made me feel like garbage, you know, and like ... you know? I'm sure that my friends would say, you know, God, I had everything. But I didn't have everything. I didn't have everything. Certainly didn't have that respect as a person.",1977
Dione_2nd,114,therapist,Carl Rogers,"But there were a lot of people who, though they may or may not have beaten you physically, treated you in a way that just trampled on you and beat you up and spit on you and made you a nobody, a piece of garbage.",1977
Dione_2nd,115,client,Dione,Right. And it won't happen again. Not if I can help it .,1977
Dione_2nd,115,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,116,client,Dione,"It's 'cause I'm really tired of fighting. Really tired of expending that kind of energy. It really is just, is straining, it's too draining, and like, you know, I don't really know what's gonna happen in terms of, you know, how I'm going to do that, you know. Get it out or or whatever, but you know, I just don't really want to say that I'm hurt or whatever, because that is ... that isn't even descriptive enough for what really happened.",1977
Dione_2nd,116,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah. To say a word like that or several of the words you've used just isn't at all the same as feeling those feelings inside and really feeling them fully.,1977
Dione_2nd,117,client,Dione,"It really is, uh, I don't know if you saw ""The Excorcist"", but it really is, really is, you know, that oohf, you know, I remember a scene in that movie where the girl who threw up this green slime, you know, and that's really, it's that, you know, it's that bad, you know, it's, you know, it's that, it's that bad. 'Cause I know it ... I know it now, you know. It's not a part of me and my body really wants to reject that, but how to, how to throw that up is ...",1977
Dione_2nd,117,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, how to ... how to vomit up that green slime that's been a part of your experience.",1977
Dione_2nd,118,client,Dione,"Yeah. Maybe I'm just afraid I'll look horrible, you know, or, or that I'd look horrible, or whatever, expressing that kind of anger, that kind of uh, that kind of hurt or whatever.",1977
Dione_2nd,118,therapist,Carl Rogers,You wouldn't look civilized; you wouldn't look cultured.,1977
Dione_2nd,119,client,Dione,"I don't, I don't know, you know. I don't really know. But right now, the ... more than getting that out, I think the, uh, the overriding thing is that I wanna keep at least that control, to control that, for fear of, you see, I don't really want to get sick again You know, and like I think this, the slightest, you know, just by being weak, by submitting to that kind of pain, um, somehow bring back my uh ...",1977
Dione_2nd,119,therapist,Carl Rogers,"You wonder about that ... whether if you, if you let out all the ... all the hell that you've experienced inside, it might uh, it might bring back your illness.",1977
Dione_2nd,120,client,Dione,"And that doesn't sound logical, does it? I know that.",1977
Dione_2nd,120,therapist,Carl Rogers,O.K.,1977
Dione_2nd,121,client,Dione,"Thank you, thank you very much. Oh, God. What a ... mmm. . I don't know. God, you know, I feel so beaten. I ... when I feel beaten right now, and I'm not sure why, but that in a way the, that I got, uh ... I really got something to say and it just, you know, and I know I'd feel better. But maybe I w- ouldn't, you know, I really talk ... God, I realize how I'm talking in circles. I seem to be talking in circles. Does it sound like uh?",1977
Dione_2nd,121,therapist,Carl Rogers,"No, not quite. It's more spirals, I think. Getting, as you say, getting very close, you feel, you feel beaten right now as though, if only something could come out, you wouldn't feel beaten.",1977
Dione_2nd,122,client,Dione,"Yeah Think that you know, just ... that turned, that almost turned me into something really inhuman.",1977
Dione_2nd,122,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,123,client,Dione,I really almost let it turn me into something really inhuman.,1977
Dione_2nd,123,therapist,Carl Rogers,It damn near made an animal out of you.,1977
Dione_2nd,124,client,Dione,"Damn near, damn near, yeah. So you see, if uh, I don't want that to happen anymore. At all. Not gonna do it to me again .",1977
Dione_2nd,124,therapist,Carl Rogers,No. That's very clear.,1977
Dione_2nd,125,client,Dione,"No. I know that doesn't help the other problem, but at least I know that , and I really do know that, you know. Because I don't think anybody has a right to do that to anybody. Nobody ... teacher, wife, husband, whatever. Uh uh, and it, and it really wasn't my fault either and uh, and like I'm not the blameless ... I mean, I'm not without any blame or whatever, but you know, you know ... just like somebody took a big goddamned tree and just rammed it up ... ooh, so, you know? Hard to describe, you know, you know?",1977
Dione_2nd,125,therapist,Carl Rogers,Took a great big stick and rammed it up your ass ... Is that what you're saying?,1977
Dione_2nd,126,client,Dione,"I, I didn't say that.",1977
Dione_2nd,126,therapist,Carl Rogers,Is that what you meant?,1977
Dione_2nd,127,client,Dione,That's what I meant.,1977
Dione_2nd,127,therapist,Carl Rogers,"OK. That's what I want to know, whether I was catching your meaning correctly.",1977
Dione_2nd,128,client,Dione,"Yeah, for sure. You know, and you know that that probably would be painful.",1977
Dione_2nd,128,therapist,Carl Rogers,And it's that kind of pain that you've suffered.,1977
Dione_2nd,129,client,Dione,"Yeah. . You just can't let it ... I just, I just can't let it happen again. I um really, uh, I just really don't know how to tell you how badly I've been hurt, you know. I really don't.",1977
Dione_2nd,129,therapist,Carl Rogers,Goes beyond words.,1977
Dione_2nd,130,client,Dione,"Yeah. But I know, you know, it's there, and maybe I should attend to it a little bit more. But, goddammit, you know, just ooh...",1977
Dione_2nd,130,therapist,Carl Rogers,You're feeling some of that hurt now.,1977
Dione_2nd,131,client,Dione,"Yeah. I am. I was thinking a ... about a wino on a street that continues to drink, doesn't have a place to live. You know I've seen so many people go by, they're the kind of person, you know, disgusting, don't want to work or whatever. But you know, I really feel like there may be some reasons. And I know one thing, I'm gonna allow that person to be desperate ... Because I'm thinking that probably people like that do things out of desperation. And um, 'cause I know, you know? I never really had a drinking problem or anything like that, but it's the kind of sensitivity that I've gotten from all of that.",1977
Dione_2nd,131,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm. It seems, it seems to me that you're uh feeling it ... you know what it's like to be in desperation and you know what it could drag you to, and so maybe that’s what’s happened to some of them. Something like that.",1977
Dione_2nd,132,client,Dione,"For sure. For sure. And I think that I ... I think my, my heart goes out to people like that, people who can't afford to to do this or whatever, and ... because see, I had a lot of money and you know, it all left. And uh, but in a way I'm happier now, you know. But I really don't know, not sure really where to go next, but I know that I don't really want that kind of life anymore. That I wanna give, I wanna help, and I wanna talk to people or whatever, and before I do that, you know, I wanna get my thing together, and a part of that is just maybe admitting, you know, and I guess maybe admitting that I'm hurt and showing and expressing my hurt or whatever will, will reaffirm the fact that I'm a person Because apart from that, I think showing that is a, you know, pulling myself up too high, you know, and that’s what everybody, you know, that's the way everything was.",1977
Dione_2nd,132,therapist,Carl Rogers,"""I don't, I don't feel it ... I don't hurt, I'm, I'm fine""... That’s a lot of bullshit.",1977
Dione_2nd,133,client,Dione,"For sure. But at least I'm admitting to you that I'm hurt, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,133,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah, that's right, mmm. And just for a moment there, I felt you really were experiencing that too, really feeling that stick shoved up your ass.",1977
Dione_2nd,134,client,Dione,"Oh, yeah, you know, when I, you know, what is, you know how your natural reaction, you know, when you start feeling stuff like that, or at least when I do, I just kind of, you know, I've got to put it all out of, out of my mind, bring it down to a different level. And I think that's what I'm doing, I keep doing, you know, when I get to the point. Gotta bring it to a safe level.",1977
Dione_2nd,134,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Yeah. That's right. You get that close, you get that close to the pit and then pull away a little.",1977
Dione_2nd,135,client,Dione,"For sure. You, you ... is it all right to have everybody else to blame? You know, for your, for your problem, instead of sharing some of that. But I shared, you know, I, I, I think I've really, I shared that, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,135,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I think ... I think what you're saying is, ""I feel as though, dammit, everybody else is to blame. My mind says, Oh, no, you have, you probably have a part in it too, but..."" ...your feelings are ...",1977
Dione_2nd,136,client,Dione,"Yeah, yeah. And I guess I hurt myself. I didn't, other people ... maybe if I can clarify that ... I let myself be hurt. You know, because I just gave too much, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,136,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Made yourself vulnerable sometimes.,1977
Dione_2nd,137,client,Dione,Really. And not sometimes ... most of the times.,1977
Dione_2nd,137,therapist,Carl Rogers,Most of the times.,1977
Dione_2nd,138,client,Dione,"You know, by being, you know, just by being, by sharing, by being there, by giving, you know, and really loving. Because I do have that sense of a total, you know, that just, I wanna love, that's my nature.",1977
Dione_2nd,138,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, mmm.",1977
Dione_2nd,139,client,Dione,"But you know, I, I've really never been this beaten. I never ... you know, never have.",1977
Dione_2nd,139,therapist,Carl Rogers,I want to be clear about your meaning. You've never felt so much of being beaten as you do right now? Is that what you're saying?,1977
Dione_2nd,140,client,Dione,"Well, through this whole thing, you know.",1977
Dione_2nd,140,therapist,Carl Rogers,Yeah.,1977
Dione_2nd,141,client,Dione,"Just beaten, you know, just really beaten, and I think that if I show you how much I've been beaten or whatever, you know, like I'd probably, you know, become nothing in this chair, you know, just ... You know?",1977
Dione_2nd,141,therapist,Carl Rogers,You might practically disappear if you really let me know how hurt and beaten and awful you feel.,1977
Dione_2nd,142,client,Dione,"Mmm, for sure. For sure. You know, I could tell you some times I mean that would just, you know, maybe blow you away, you know. ... Really too much for me.",1977
Dione_2nd,142,therapist,Carl Rogers,Hmm?,1977
Dione_2nd,143,client,Dione,It's really too much for me.,1977
Dione_2nd,143,therapist,Carl Rogers,Too much. Mmm.,1977
Dione_2nd,144,client,Dione,I feel like it.,1977
Dione_2nd,144,therapist,Carl Rogers,"I, I think you feel as though, ""I've gone about as far as I can go at this point"".",1977
Dione_2nd,145,client,Dione,"Yeah. Mmm, yeah, really. When I start smiling, I know I am.",1977
Dione_2nd,145,therapist,Carl Rogers,Mmm. Taking a drink of water.,1977
Dione_2nd,146,client,Dione,"For sure. Well, you know, but I'm being truthful about it anyway.",1977
Dione_2nd,146,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I feel, I feel too. Uh, you've walked around that pit of hurt and pain and beaten-ness, and you've, you've felt some of it and uh, and perhaps that's as far as you can go right at this moment.",1977
Dione_2nd,147,client,Dione,Yeah.,1977
Dione_2nd,147,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Even though you know there's more there, you know that you're keeping some of it down. Um and to know those things may be helpful too.",1977
Dione_2nd,148,client,Dione,"Yeah. You see, because I, I can talk about this leukemia and and all this stuff and everything like that and ... well, I guess it's you know...",1977
Dione_2nd,148,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Fascinating. And it's easier to talk about leukemia and the possibility of death and all that, than it is to talk about all the hurt and awfulness that you've suffered.",1977
Dione_2nd,149,client,Dione,"Yeah. Whew, oh, I really, whew, a lot, you know . I have to stop. OK?",1977
Dione_2nd,149,therapist,Carl Rogers,"OK. All right, mmm. Gone about as far as you can go.",1977
Dione_2nd,150,client,Dione,Right.,1977
Dione_2nd,150,therapist,Carl Rogers,"Mmm. OK, we'll call it quits.",1977
