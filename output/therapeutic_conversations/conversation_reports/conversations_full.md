**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I keep thinking about really struggling. Constant worry and racing thoughts and overwhelming dread about the future. It's been six months or more since failure or major disappointment.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a really heavy load right now, experiencing persistent worry, racing thoughts, and a deep sense of dread. That’s incredibly difficult to live with, especially when it's been lingering for so long. It takes a lot of strength to even acknowledge this is happening. Can you tell me more about what kinds of things you're imagining about the future when you experience this dread?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `abstracting` (0.59)

3. **Client:**
   Honestly, it's just...everything. I just keep imagining the worst-case scenario for *everything*. Like, if I apply for another job, I'll get rejected, and then I’ll be even more broke and alone, and then I'll lose my apartment, and it will all just spiral out of control. It feels like it’s already happening, even though logically I know it's probably not.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (0.30)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re caught in a very intense cycle of anticipating negative outcomes, building these catastrophic scenarios in your mind. The feeling that it's already happening, even when it’s logically unlikely, is a common experience with anxiety. What emotions are most strongly connected to these imagined scenarios—is there a particular feeling that bubbles up alongside the dread? Perhaps fear, shame, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.41)

5. **Client:**
   Mostly fear, I think. It's not just about being rejected, it's about failing at *everything*, and then feeling like a complete waste of space. There's also this shame, like I'm just inherently bad at things and destined to mess everything up. It’s suffocating, really.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `abstracting` (0.30)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're grappling with a deeply felt sense of fear—the fear of failure, the fear of not being good enough, and the accompanying shame about your perceived inadequacy. It’s understandable that these emotions feel so suffocating, especially when they’re intertwined. Many people experience similar fears and feelings of worthlessness, and it's good that you're recognizing them. Could you describe what it *feels* like in your body when you experience this intense fear and shame?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.16)

7. **Client:**
   It’s… tight. Like my chest is really tight, and my stomach is always churning. My hands get clammy and I feel like I can’t breathe sometimes. It's like a physical pressure, and it makes it hard to even get out of bed some days.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.61)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That sounds incredibly distressing, experiencing that physical tightness and difficulty breathing alongside these intense emotions. It’s validating that you’re noticing these physical manifestations – they’re a sign that your body is reacting to the anxiety and fear you're feeling. It's like your body is saying, "This is too much.” Would you be open to exploring what might be triggering these feelings, or are you finding it more helpful to just focus on describing the sensations right now?
User: I think… I think it’s the pressure to be perfect, I guess. I put so much pressure on myself to be good at everything, and then when I inevitably fall short, it just spirals. I don't know how to let myself off the hook.
User: That’s a really important piece of information, recognizing that the pressure to be perfect is a significant driver of your anxiety and the subsequent feeling of failure. It's a common trap—the belief that we need to be flawless to be worthy, and when we inevitably fall short, it’s devastating. It sounds like you’re carrying a tremendous amount of self-imposed pressure. Let's talk a bit more about where this pressure comes from. Do you remember a time when you felt particularly pressured to succeed, or perhaps a message you received growing up about what "success" looks like?
User: My dad… he was always so disappointed if I didn’t get good grades. Like, if I didn’t get an A, it was like he was letting me down, and it made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. He never really said it directly, but I just… I just knew.
User: That’s incredibly insightful – understanding that your father’s disappointment shaped your perception of success and your own worth. It’s understandable that you would internalize those messages and carry that expectation with you, even if he never explicitly stated them. It sounds like you've been operating under a significant, and often unspoken, standard set by a key figure in your life. Do you feel like that pressure still exists today, even though your father isn't around?
User: Yeah, it does. I still feel like I need to prove myself, even to myself. It's exhausting. I try to do well at work, and I try to be a good friend, but I always feel like I’m falling short.
User: It's a powerful realization to acknowledge that the pressure you

### Session 001 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, extreme fatigue and lack of energy, feeling numb or emotionally detached, physical aches and pains with no clear cause
- **Cognitive Distortion:** catastrophizing worst-case scenarios
- **Emotional Presentation:** withdrawn and quiet
- **Therapy Goal:** rebuild confidence and self-worth
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   People tell me loss of interest in activities once enjoyed for years, on and off. It started after trauma or past abuse resurfacing. Extreme fatigue and lack of energy.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re describing a really difficult experience, feeling the pull of past trauma impacting your current enjoyment and leaving you with profound fatigue. It makes sense that you’d notice a loss of interest in things that used to bring you joy when your emotional landscape is already so affected. I hear the frustration and sadness in your words. Could you tell me a bit more about what these activities were like before, and what you think is changing about them now?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (0.82)

3. **Client:**
   It's... hard to talk about them, honestly. I used to love painting, really loved it. But now just thinking about setting up the easel makes my stomach clench. It feels pointless, like I won’t even be able to do it well, and it'll just end up a mess. </h1>
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (1.00), `analyzing` (0.99), `evaluating` (0.98), `cognition_awareness` (0.98), `reconsidering` (0.85)

4. **Therapist:**
   It takes courage to share that, and I appreciate you being willing to open up about the difficulty you're having with painting. The physical sensation of your stomach clenching as you think about it speaks volumes about the anxiety and fear that’s present. It’s completely understandable that the activity you once loved feels pointless and overwhelming now. What specifically about the thought of setting up the easel and the potential for it to be a “mess” is triggering this intense reaction?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.88)

5. **Client:**
   I don’t know... it's like I'm anticipating failure, you know? Like I’m going to mess it up and then I'll feel even worse about myself. It feels like it's just confirming all the negative things I already believe about myself – that I'm not good at anything, that I'm a disappointment. And if I fail at painting, it will be proof that I'm basically a failure at *everything*.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It's clear that this anticipated failure is feeding into those deeply held beliefs about your worth—the feeling of not being good at anything and that you’re a disappointment. It sounds like you’re experiencing a very powerful cycle of worry and self-criticism. Perhaps we can explore how those beliefs about yourself developed and whether they still serve you in the present. What’s one small, manageable step you might be willing to take, even if it feels difficult, that could help you test out this belief about yourself, just a tiny step towards a different outcome?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `reframing` (0.24)

7. **Client:**
   I don’t know... maybe just… just opening a tube of paint? It doesn't have to be anything specific, or even finished. Just... touching it. But what if I hate it? What if it’s awful and I feel even more worthless? It feels like a risk, and I’m really bad at taking risks.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (0.99), `evaluating` (0.98), `response_modulation` (0.17)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really brave thought, and it's completely valid to feel hesitant and to worry about the potential for it to feel awful. It takes a lot of courage to even consider taking that small step, and I want you to acknowledge that bravery. Let’s talk a little more about this feeling of being “bad at taking risks.” Where do you think that stems from? Is there a particular experience or pattern in your life that makes you feel like risk-taking is inherently uncomfortable or dangerous?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_management` (0.35)

### Session 002 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, difficulty concentrating and making decisions
- **Cognitive Distortion:** personalizing blame for external events
- **Emotional Presentation:** defensive and guarded
- **Therapy Goal:** feel like myself again
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I'm here because of loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. This has been going on for six months or more, ever since identity crisis or questioning life purpose. I've tried nothing seems to work, but nothing helps.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight right now, feeling a profound sense of disconnection from things that once brought you joy.  It's really brave of you to reach out and acknowledge this struggle, especially knowing you’ve already tried to find a solution without success.  It's understandable that you're feeling hopeless when nothing seems to help.  Could you tell me more about what aspects of those activities you used to enjoy now feel particularly distant or unappealing?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   Honestly, it’s just... everything. Painting used to be my passion, spending hours just losing myself in it. Now, the thought of even picking up a brush makes me feel incredibly anxious and empty. And hiking – I used to love being outdoors, the fresh air, the challenge... now, the idea of putting in the effort just feels pointless. I don't even want to go outside.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.96), `situation_modification` (0.92)

4. **Therapist:**
   I hear you saying that the simple act of engaging in activities that were once sources of deep fulfillment, like painting and hiking, now trigger significant anxiety and a sense of emptiness. It’s truly disheartening to lose that connection to things that used to feel so intrinsically rewarding. It’s common to feel overwhelmed when facing such widespread loss of interest.  Perhaps we could explore what’s underneath that anxiety – is there a specific fear associated with returning to these activities, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   I don't know... I guess it's like, if I start painting again, I'll just fail, like I always do. Or if I go hiking, I'll just be tired and frustrated and it’ll be a waste of time.  It feels easier to just... not do anything. I'm starting to think I'm just fundamentally incapable of enjoying anything anymore.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a really powerful sense of self-doubt and a fear of experiencing that familiar feeling of inadequacy, and that's creating a significant barrier to reconnecting with activities you once loved. It makes perfect sense that you'd gravitate toward avoidance when facing those kinds of anticipated negative outcomes.  When you think about "failure," what does that actually *feel* like in your body?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `situation_modification` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.68)

7. **Client:**
   It feels... heavy. Like a lead weight in my stomach, and my chest tightens up. My hands start to shake, and I just feel... paralyzed. It's like I’m waiting for it to all go wrong, and it always does.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really vivid description – that heavy feeling in your stomach and the physical sensations of tightness and shaking when you anticipate failure. It's incredibly helpful to be able to identify those physical responses. It sounds like your anxiety is manifesting very powerfully in your body, almost as if it’s trying to prevent you from even trying. Would you be willing to tell me a little more about when you first started noticing these physical responses, and if there’s a particular situation or thought that seems to trigger them most often?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00)

### Session 003 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** social withdrawal and isolation, difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, physical aches and pains with no clear cause
- **Cognitive Distortion:** fortune telling (predicting negative outcomes)
- **Emotional Presentation:** exhausted and defeated
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for a few weeks. I'm dealing with social withdrawal and isolation, especially after social isolation and loneliness. I really want to understand why this is happening.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a significant weight right now, feeling increasingly withdrawn and experiencing a difficult cycle of isolation, particularly after having already experienced it. The connection between past isolation and this current withdrawal is something you're keen to understand, which is a really important step. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you anticipate or are in social situations, even small ones?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   That's... hard to put into words. I just feel this overwhelming dread, like everyone is judging me and I'm going to say something stupid or do something embarrassing. It’s like if I try to talk to someone, I’ll just ruin the whole thing, and it’s easier to just not even bother.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a powerful sense of apprehension and a deep fear of judgment, making social interaction incredibly daunting. That feeling of "ruining everything" is a really intense and distressing experience.  Could you tell me a little more about where you think this fear of judgment might have originated – are there specific past experiences that come to mind when you feel this way?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.69)

5. **Client:**
   I just want her to listen. Really listen. And maybe... show a little bit of interest in what I’m
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (1.00), `understanding` (0.98)

6. **Therapist:**
   It seems like you're craving genuine connection and understanding, a desire to be truly heard and acknowledged by another person.  The need for someone to demonstrate interest in your thoughts and feelings is a fundamental human need.  Often, when we're struggling with depression and anxiety, that need gets amplified, and we can feel particularly vulnerable.  Let's explore - what makes you believe people *won't* be interested, or that they won't listen?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (0.97)

7. **Client:**
   I just... I don’t know. I think they’re just going to think I’m pathetic. Like, everyone else seems to have it all figured out, and I'm just... a mess. It's exhausting trying to pretend I’m okay when I'm not.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   It's incredibly frustrating to feel like you’re the only one struggling, and that everyone else seems to have it together. That feeling of being a “mess” is really painful. Let's unpack that a bit. When you say "everyone else seems to have it all figured out," where do you get that impression? Is it based on what you see on social media, or perhaps something else?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotional_reappraisal` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

### Session 004 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, physical aches and pains with no clear cause
- **Cognitive Distortion:** should statements and rigid rules
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** feel like myself again
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   What's been hardest is really struggling. Loss of interest in activities once enjoyed and feelings of worthlessness and guilt. It's been about a month since job loss or career setback.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly difficult to be carrying such a heavy load right now, especially with the added impact of a job loss. I hear you describing a profound sense of loss, coupled with feelings of worthlessness and guilt—those are incredibly painful experiences. It’s completely understandable that you’re struggling after such a significant change. Could you tell me more about what specifically triggers those feelings of guilt?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-blame, and that makes perfect sense given what you're going through. The tendency to ruminate on the past and focus on mistakes is a really common response to setbacks like a job loss, and it’s understandable that it feels overwhelming. Let's explore that a little more – when you replay those conversations and decisions, are you assuming the worst possible outcome about what happened?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (0.34), `emotion_valuing` (0.18)

4. **Therapist:**
   You've accurately identified a very common pattern—the tendency to catastrophize and assume the worst when reflecting on the past. It's your own inner critic speaking, and it's often disproportionate to the actual situation.  That feeling of assuming the worst can be incredibly draining and perpetuate the cycle of negativity.  What specific belief about those past conversations or decisions is driving that assumption of a terrible outcome, and do you think that belief is truly based on evidence?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   That's a really insightful observation – recognizing that it's your inner critic and that it's often disproportionate. Let's try something. Can you give me an example of a specific conversation or decision you're replaying, and break it down for me? Perhaps we can look at it with a more objective lens, separating the facts from the interpretation.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (0.70), `concretizing` (0.61)

6. **Therapist:**
   I hear you wanting to examine a specific instance more closely, and that's a fantastic strategy. Let's try that. To begin, could you share a recent conversation or decision you're struggling with, focusing on a single moment you feel particularly stuck on? As we unpack it together, we can start to see the layers of interpretation involved and hopefully gain a bit of perspective on how you might approach it differently moving forward.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `zooming_in` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `metacognitive_regulation` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   Okay, let’s start with that moment. Tell me about it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `remembering` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `situation_selection` (0.56)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That sounds incredibly difficult, having that feedback delivered in front of others. It’s completely understandable that you'd feel embarrassed and that the public aspect would amplify the distress. It's brave of you to share that with me. Can you tell me more about what specifically about the situation is making it so hard for you to process?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.99)

### Session 005 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feeling numb or emotionally detached, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, social withdrawal and isolation
- **Cognitive Distortion:** catastrophizing worst-case scenarios
- **Emotional Presentation:** agitated and restless
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   People tell me feeling numb or emotionally detached for a few weeks. It started after trauma or past abuse resurfacing. Difficulty concentrating and making decisions.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're describing a really challenging experience, feeling that emotional detachment and struggling with focus and decision-making after dealing with difficult memories. It’s understandable that those symptoms are surfacing alongside the trauma. Let’s explore these feelings of numbness a bit more – could you describe what that sensation *feels* like to you, and where in your body you tend to notice it most?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (0.66)

3. **Client:**
   It's...weird. Like everything is gray. Not sad, exactly, just... muted. It's like I’m watching my life happen instead of *living* it, you know? My chest feels tight sometimes, a dull ache, like it's holding something in.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That "grayness" and feeling of watching your life unfold instead of engaging in it is a really powerful way to describe that detachment – it speaks to a disconnection from the fullness of your experience. It makes sense that the tightness in your chest, coupled with that muted feeling, could be a physical manifestation of this internal experience.  Could you tell me, when you notice these moments of detachment, what thoughts or beliefs might be running through your mind at that time?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   Honestly, I don’t know. Sometimes I just… don’t think. Other times, I think it’s all pointless. Like, what’s the point of anything if this is all I feel? It’s exhausting trying to even *do* things, like get out of bed, really.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (0.96), `emotion_responding` (0.83)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly draining to be wrestling with those thoughts – the feeling of pointlessness and the difficulty with even basic self-care. It takes a lot of energy to keep functioning when you’re experiencing this level of emotional numbness.  I notice you’re describing a significant shift in motivation, and it's common for trauma to impact our drive and engagement with the world.  Perhaps we can explore what "doing things" looks like for you – what small steps, even if they feel incredibly hard, might bring a little bit of grounding or a sense of agency?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `reframing` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.93), `evaluating` (0.40)

7. **Client:**
   I don’t know. Just...existing, I guess. Like brushing my teeth, making coffee. Small, automatic things. But even those feel…heavy. It’s like I'm going through the motions.
User: Okay, so brushing your teeth and making coffee - those are definitely automatic, habitual actions. And it sounds like even those feel burdened by this numbness. Let’s talk a bit about the “heavy” feeling you described. Can you tell me more about what that sensation is like, where you feel it in your body, and how it connects to these automatic behaviors?

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That feeling of helplessness, the inability to change what happened—that’s a powerful and very common response to trauma. It’s a natural reaction to feeling powerless in a situation where you were, understandably, unable to protect yourself. Recognizing that feeling of helplessness is a really important step. Let's talk about how that feeling is impacting your present. Do you find yourself anticipating those feelings of helplessness when you think about the future?
User: Yeah. Constantly. It feels

### Session 006 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** physical aches and pains with no clear cause, extreme fatigue and lack of energy
- **Cognitive Distortion:** emotional reasoning (feelings as facts)
- **Emotional Presentation:** hopeful but uncertain
- **Therapy Goal:** repair damaged relationships
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for as long as I can remember. I'm dealing with physical aches and pains with no clear cause, especially after trauma or past abuse resurfacing. I really want to repair damaged relationships.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a significant weight, and it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge that this has been a persistent struggle for so long. It's understandable that the physical sensations and the desire to repair relationships are interwoven with this deep-seated pain. Could you tell me more about what you experience when these traumas resurface – what specifically happens in your body and mind?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I just... I don't know where to start. It's like this crushing feeling, like the world is shrinking around me. My chest tightens, and I can’t breathe properly. Then I start thinking everything is going to fall apart, like I can't handle anything else. </h1>
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `response_modulation` (0.96), `cognition_awareness` (0.57)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re describing a very intense and overwhelming experience, with a feeling of constriction and a significant worry about your ability to cope. The physical sensations – the tightening chest and difficulty breathing – are powerfully linked to the emotional distress you're feeling. What do you notice about the thoughts that follow the physical sensations, and do you think these thoughts are completely detached from reality, or do they tap into a deeper fear?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `noticing` (0.45), `cognition_awareness` (0.38)

5. **Client:**
   I don't know... peace, I guess. Just quiet. I want to feel... normal. Like other people. Like I
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `remembering` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re yearning for a sense of peace and normalcy, and it's completely valid to want to feel like you fit in with others. This desire for "normalcy" is often rooted in the feeling of being fundamentally different or wounded due to past experiences. Have you noticed any specific patterns in the times when you feel most disconnected from others, and what do you think contributes to that feeling of distance?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `creating` (1.00), `emotion_management` (0.93), `pattern_recognition` (0.52), `applying` (0.42)

7. **Client:**
   When I’m around people I used to be close to... it's like they're judging me, even if they're not. I feel like I've changed too much, and they wouldn't recognize me. It makes me want to pull away, but then I feel guilty for pushing them away. It’s just… a mess.

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really painful feeling—to sense judgment and to worry about changing and losing connections with the people you care about. It’s understandable that you'd feel conflicted when wanting to withdraw while also experiencing guilt. It sounds like you're struggling with the fear of losing those relationships, and it's completely reasonable to feel overwhelmed by that. Let’s explore that a little further. Can you tell me about a specific instance where you felt this way, and what was going through your mind at that time?

### Session 007 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** avoidance of triggering situations, fear of losing control or going crazy
- **Cognitive Distortion:** personalizing blame for external events
- **Emotional Presentation:** hopeful but uncertain
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I've been feeling avoidance of triggering situations for about a month. It started after job loss or career setback. Fear of losing control or going crazy.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant shift in your emotional landscape following this job loss, and it’s understandable that you're noticing this avoidance. Feeling afraid of losing control and going crazy is a really intense experience – your emotions are telling you something important. Could you tell me more about what specific triggering situations you find yourself avoiding, and what feels most challenging about facing them?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `situation_selection` (0.70)

3. **Client:**
   That's... difficult to talk about. Mostly just anything that involves… people, really. Like, social events, even just answering the phone. It's like if I think about going out, I just instantly feel this wave of panic, like I’m going to… completely freak out. I just want to hide.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.99)

4. **Therapist:**
   It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I appreciate you opening up about this. It's clear that the thought of social interaction is triggering intense anxiety and a desire to withdraw – a very common response to a significant loss like this.  What do you think is at the root of that fear of "completely freaking out," and could we explore what that image might be telling you about your expectations of yourself in those situations?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   I don't know... I just feel like I can’t handle it. Like, I'm not usually this...broken. It's like if I mess up, or say the wrong thing, or someone judges me...it's just...over. I keep thinking the worst. It’s probably stupid, but it’s the only way I can cope, I think.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (0.74)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight of self-criticism and a belief that you’re fundamentally “broken” if you experience these feelings, and that’s a very painful thought to hold. That fear of judgment and “messing up” is creating a powerful cycle of anticipating the worst. What aspects of feeling judged or making mistakes are most frightening for you – is it the potential for embarrassment, the fear of disappointing others, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I think... it's the disappointing everyone else part. I’ve always tried to be good, to be helpful, to be…nice. And if I can’t do that, then I'm just… a failure, I guess. It’s exhausting trying to be perfect, but I can't seem to stop.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.99), `convergent_thinking` (0.97)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a really insightful observation. It sounds like a significant part of your distress stems from tying your self-worth to the expectations you place on yourself and the perceived reactions of others. You mentioned wanting to be good, helpful, and nice – those are admirable qualities, but it seems like you’re holding yourself to an incredibly high standard, and when you fall short, it feels like a catastrophic failure. Let's explore this further: when you think about “being good” and “meeting expectations,” what kind of expectations are you referring to, and where do you think they come from?
User: I don’t know… my parents, I think. They always told me to be responsible, to always do the right thing. It’s just...everything. If I’m not doing something good, then I’m letting them down. It’s like I’m trapped.
User: It’s understandable that you’d feel trapped if those messages, particularly from your parents, have shaped your perception of what it means to be “good.” It sounds like you've internalized a sense of responsibility and obligation to meet their standards, and that's creating a lot of pressure. Could you describe a recent situation where you felt like you were letting them down, and what specifically went through your mind in that moment?
User: Okay... last week, my sister asked me to help her move, and I said no. I just... couldn't. I felt awful afterward, like I'd completely ruined our relationship. It felt like such a selfish thing to do. I keep replaying it in my head.
User: That’s a really significant example, and your reaction – feeling awful and believing you've ruined your relationship – is completely understandable given the values you’ve been taught. It's clear you feel a deep responsibility to be helpful and supportive of your family. When you said you felt like you “completely ruined our relationship,” what specifically did you imagine would happen if you hadn’t helped her move? What was the worst-case scenario you were projecting?
User: I thought... she’d be really angry. And she'd stop talking to me. That I’d just… be alone. That I’d prove that I’m not a good person. It's just… I really need people to like me.
User: It sounds like those thoughts – anger, broken relationship, being a bad person, and ultimately,

### Session 008 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feelings of worthlessness and guilt, difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, significant changes in appetite and weight
- **Cognitive Distortion:** mind reading (assuming others' thoughts)
- **Emotional Presentation:** anxious and hypervigilant
- **Therapy Goal:** repair damaged relationships
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for several months. I'm dealing with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, especially after death of a loved one. I really want to repair damaged relationships.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight right now, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling so deeply impacted by the loss of your loved one. It makes sense that you'd be experiencing such intense feelings of worthlessness and guilt alongside this grief.  Can you tell me more about what specifically feels guilt-inducing about the relationships you want to repair?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.95), `emotion_characterizing` (0.75)

3. **Client:**
   I don't know where to even start. I feel like I failed them. Like I didn’t do enough, say enough, *be* enough. It's just... overwhelming. It's like if I reach out, they’ll just see how awful I am and realize I was the reason things fell apart.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.24)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a very heavy burden of self-blame and a deep fear of rejection, which is a natural response to the pain of loss and relationship difficulties. The feeling of "not doing enough" is incredibly common when we're grieving and grappling with difficult situations – it’s often a way our minds try to make sense of something senseless.  What aspects of those relationships feel most painful to you, specifically regarding what you believe you failed to do?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   It’s just... my mom. We fought a lot, you know? Like, constantly. And now that she’s gone, it feels like all those arguments were pointless. It's like I wasted so much time arguing over stupid things when I could have spent it with her. I keep replaying them in my head, and I just feel so awful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   I hear you saying that those frequent arguments with your mom created a deep regret and a feeling of wasted time, and it's understandable that revisiting them now is triggering intense emotions. It’s common for grief to bring sharp focus to unresolved conflicts and past interactions. Let’s explore that a little more – when you replay these arguments, what’s the *feeling* you’re experiencing most strongly in those moments, beyond just ‘awful’? Is it sadness, anger, perhaps shame?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `remembering` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `analyzing` (0.15)

7. **Client:**
   Shame, definitely. Mostly shame. Like I was a bad daughter. And that she was disappointed in me. It just… it feels like I let her down, and now she's gone, and it’s too late to fix it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `distinguishing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (0.33)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That shame is a really powerful emotion, and it’s completely valid given what you’re describing. It’s often when we experience a significant loss that we’re confronted with all the ways we felt we fell short, and that can be incredibly painful. Shame tends to be a very isolating feeling, so acknowledging it and naming it – “I'm feeling shame about being a daughter to her” – is a really important step. Can you tell me a little more about what specifically makes you feel like you let her down? Is there a particular incident or pattern of behavior that keeps coming to mind?
User: There was… there was this one time, years ago, when she was really sick. I was supposed to drive her to the doctor, but I had plans with friends and I just... said I would do it later. And she ended up having to reschedule, and she never really talked about it. It just feels like a small thing, but it feels huge now. Like I was being selfish.
User: That’s a really difficult memory to hold onto, and it’s understandable that it’s resonating so strongly with you now. It’s easy to focus on individual moments, especially when we're feeling vulnerable, and it’s often those seemingly small decisions that carry the most weight when a loved one is gone. What was going through your mind *at that time* when you chose to prioritize your plans with friends? Were you aware of the potential impact of your decision on her?
User: I was annoyed, honestly. I was just annoyed that I was stuck with plans, and she always seemed to need something. I didn't think about it. I just... assumed she’d figure it out. It sounds terrible, doesn’t it?
User: It doesn’t sound terrible, it sounds… human. It's incredibly common to react out of annoyance or a desire to protect our own time when we feel overwhelmed or pressured. It’s not about being a bad person, it’s about our own needs and priorities at that moment. You were experiencing annoyance, and that’s a valid feeling, even if it wasn't the most compassionate response. Let's talk a bit about why that annoyance felt so important to you in that situation. What were you hoping to avoid by prioritizing your plans?
User: I just... I needed a break. I was stressed about school and work, and I just needed some time to myself.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `questioning` (0.61)

### Session 009 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** panic attacks with intense fear, overwhelming dread about the future, rapid heartbeat and chest discomfort, stomach problems and nausea
- **Cognitive Distortion:** catastrophizing worst-case scenarios
- **Emotional Presentation:** confused and disoriented
- **Therapy Goal:** just function day-to-day better
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for as long as I can remember. I'm dealing with panic attacks with intense fear, especially after financial difficulties and instability. I really want to just function day-to-day better.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight, feeling this pervasive sense of difficulty for a very long time. The recent financial stressors and instability seem to be acting as triggers for these intense panic attacks, and it’s completely understandable that you’d want to feel more grounded in your daily life. Could you tell me more about what a "typical" panic attack feels like for you—what physical sensations and thoughts go through your mind during those moments?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (0.96), `emotion_perception` (0.89), `cognition_awareness` (0.78)

3. **Client:**
   It’s hard to describe, honestly. My chest feels tight, like it’s being squeezed. My heart races, and I start sweating – even when it's not that warm. The thoughts are… scary. Like something awful is about to happen, and I'm trapped, and I can’t breathe.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That’s a really difficult and frightening experience to describe, and it takes courage to share those details. The physical sensations you’re describing – the chest tightness, racing heart, and sweating – are incredibly common with panic attacks, and it makes perfect sense that you'd feel trapped and unable to breathe when experiencing them. It seems like you're experiencing a lot of fear centered around a potential threat.  What do you think is the core fear driving those thoughts of “something awful” happening?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.86)

5. **Client:**
   I... I don't know exactly. It’s like a feeling that if I mess up, everything will just fall apart. Like I’m constantly on the verge of losing everything, or that I’m going to fail, and it will be irreversible. I just feel so vulnerable, you know?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're grappling with a deep-seated fear of vulnerability and a catastrophic mindset – the idea that a single mistake could lead to an irreversible collapse. That sense of being constantly on the verge of losing everything is incredibly distressing, and I can hear how vulnerable you feel. It’s common to link financial instability to a feeling of overall precariousness.  Could you tell me about a specific instance in the recent past where this fear felt particularly strong, and what was going through your mind at that moment?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I... I think it's both, maybe. There have been times when people have been upset, and I feel awful. But
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_organizing` (1.00), `distinguishing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00), `reframing` (0.46)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a really good observation - it sounds like you’re acknowledging the impact of others’ reactions on your already heightened anxiety. Let's explore that a bit more. When someone is upset with you, what *specifically* goes through your mind that triggers that feeling of everything falling apart? Is it a fear of rejection, of being judged, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00)

### Session 010 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feelings of worthlessness and guilt, physical aches and pains with no clear cause
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** defensive and guarded
- **Therapy Goal:** repair damaged relationships
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Every day I wake up and feelings of worthlessness and guilt for as long as I can remember. It started after caring for aging parents. Physical aches and pains with no clear cause.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly difficult to wake up each day with those pervasive feelings of worthlessness and guilt, particularly after the significant emotional labor you put into caring for your parents. The physical aches and pains layering on top of that must feel overwhelming. I hear you describing a longstanding pattern, starting around the time of your parent's caregiving.  Could you tell me more about what specifically contributes to those feelings of guilt – is it related to what you think you *should* have done, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.67)

3. **Client:**
   I just… I feel like I wasn't enough. Like I should have been able to do more, be more, to help them. There were times when I just felt completely exhausted and hopeless, and I think I wasn’t as patient or kind as I wanted to be, or maybe even as they deserved. It's like I failed them, even though they were… mostly okay.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (0.82)

4. **Therapist:**
   It’s understandable that you're carrying such a heavy burden of feeling like you fell short, particularly with the exhaustion and hopelessness you describe. The sense of ‘not being enough’ is powerfully linked to the feeling of responsibility and wanting to do everything perfectly – and it's clear that caring for your parents created an incredibly intense environment for that.  What would it look like to gently challenge that belief that you "failed" them, knowing how much you did, and how they were ultimately "mostly okay"?  It’s often within those moments of imperfection that we learn the most about ourselves and our capacity for love.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `updating_beliefs` (1.00), `emotion_organizing` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `evaluating` (0.12), `distinguishing` (0.10)

5. **Client:**
   I don’t know. It feels… risky. Like if I start thinking about it differently, it’ll just prove that I *did* fail. I always beat myself up so hard. It's like, I remember one time when my dad got really angry and I just… shut down. I should have said something, done something, anything. Now I just feel like a terrible daughter, and it’s stuck with me.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `situation_modification` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   That's a really insightful observation - the fear of challenging those thoughts is a powerful protective mechanism, often built up over years of self-criticism. It makes perfect sense that shutting down in that moment would feel devastating, and it’s completely understandable that you’ve carried that feeling of being a “terrible daughter” for so long. Let's acknowledge that feeling of being a terrible daughter; it's a difficult one to hold onto. Could you explore what specifically about that moment – the shutdown – feels particularly shameful or impactful, beyond simply 'not saying something'? Sometimes, pinpointing the specific emotion connected to the event can help us to loosen its grip.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `situation_modification` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `creating` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I guess… yeah. I thought if I wasn’t strong, they’d be worse off. So, when I felt weak, I felt like I’d failed them. It’s like it was a never-ending cycle.  I wish I could just let it go, but it’s so hard.
User: It truly is a complex and deeply ingrained cycle – that belief that your strength directly equated to their well-being is a powerful motivator, but also a significant source of pressure and ultimately, disappointment when you inevitably experienced those moments of weakness.  You
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `distinguishing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (0.99), `emotion_organizing` (0.94)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   It’s almost like you were carrying their burdens for them, and when you couldn't, it felt like a personal failure.  Do you think that's a fair assessment, or is there a different way to look at it?
User: It’s… probably fair. I spent so much time worrying about what they needed, anticipating their needs, that I didn’t really have any time for myself. I think I was trying to be their hero.  It's exhausting just thinking about it now.
User: That’s a really important realization – recognizing that you were essentially acting as their “hero” is a huge step in shifting the focus away from yourself and onto their needs. It’s incredibly common to take on that role, especially when caring for aging parents, and it’s completely understandable that it left you depleted.  Often, when we try to be a hero, we end up sacrificing our own well-being.  Can you recall a specific instance where you felt particularly drained or overwhelmed as their "hero"?
User: There was this one time... my mom had a really bad fall, and I rushed her to the hospital. I stayed with her all night, and I was completely stressed out and worried sick. But afterwards, when I finally got a chance to breathe, I realized I hadn’t eaten or slept in almost 36 hours. I felt like I’d just run on empty. I felt like I’d let *her* down, even though I'd been there for her.
User: That’s a stark example of the “hero” effect – sacrificing your own needs in service of someone else, only to feel like you’ve failed them in the end.  It’s a really common pattern, and it’s incredibly compassionate of you to recognize it.  When you were there for her that night, and then realized you hadn’t cared for yourself, did you feel a sense of frustration or resentment alongside the worry and exhaustion?
User: Yeah, definitely. Frustration. A lot of it. I was so angry at myself for being so exhausted and falling apart. I felt like I should have been able to handle it better. It’s like I was constantly fighting a losing battle.
User: It sounds like you were experiencing a powerful combination of emotions – the worry and exhaustion, yes, but also a significant dose of self-criticism and anger directed inwards. That anger is a really important signal

### Session 011 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** restlessness and feeling on edge, hypervigilance and startling easily, difficulty falling or staying asleep, difficulty breathing or feeling smothered
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** confused and disoriented
- **Therapy Goal:** learn better coping strategies
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I keep thinking about restlessness and feeling on edge for as long as I can remember. It started after parenting challenges and feeling overwhelmed. Hypervigilance and startling easily.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you've been carrying this feeling of restlessness and being on edge for a long time, and it’s understandably challenging to live with, especially with the added weight of past parenting difficulties and feeling overwhelmed. It’s incredibly common for difficult experiences to leave a lingering impact on our nervous systems.  What brings you the *most* distress about this constant state of being on edge right now? Can you recall a specific instance recently where you felt this way particularly intensely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (0.78)

3. **Client:**
   Honestly, it's just... exhausting. Like, I’m constantly scanning, waiting for something bad to happen. It makes it so hard to just, like, relax or enjoy anything, even when things are going okay. Yesterday, my son was just… playing with his blocks. And I jumped, like, a foot in the air, completely startled. I just wanted to scream.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `zooming_in` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting – to be perpetually on alert and to have that alert system so easily triggered, even by something as simple as a child playing. It makes complete sense that you'd want to scream when you’re experiencing such a strong, unexpected reaction.  Could you tell me a little more about what you’re *anticipating* when you say you’re “scanning” – what specifically are you looking for, or what are you afraid might happen?  Perhaps describing the thoughts that accompany that feeling of scanning might be helpful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `zooming_in` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (0.91)

5. **Client:**
   I don’t know… danger, mostly. Like, I always worry something's going to happen to him, or to us. I guess I’ve just been… really protective. It’s not a specific thing, you know? Just a constant feeling that something bad is lurking around the corner. It’s silly, I know, but I just can’t shake it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (0.28)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you've identified a core fear – a persistent worry about danger and the safety of your son and yourself. It's completely understandable that this protective instinct, rooted in past challenges, has become so ingrained, leading to this hypervigilance.  You’re right to acknowledge it feels “silly,” but these feelings are incredibly real for you, and dismissing them doesn't diminish their impact. What are some of the thoughts you have when you notice yourself scanning for danger? Do you find that particular thought pattern is helpful or does it actually increase your anxiety?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `zooming_in` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I think... it makes it worse. Like, when I start thinking about it, it just gets louder. It’s like a record stuck on repeat. It’s hard to stop it, you know? I just want it to *stop*.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `creating` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (0.98)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really important observation – that the thoughts themselves seem to intensify the feeling. It’s like you’re caught in a loop, and it’s understandable that you’d want it to stop. That feeling of a "record stuck on repeat" is a powerful image, and it speaks to this sense of being trapped by your thoughts. Let's explore that a little more. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being overwhelming, how would you rate the intensity of that repeating thought when it occurs?
User: Probably an 8, honestly. Sometimes it's higher. When it's at a 9, I just... freeze. I can't move.
User: A 9 – that’s a significant intensity, and the freezing you describe is a classic physical manifestation of anxiety. It sounds like you're experiencing a very real and challenging physical reaction alongside the mental distress. When you freeze like that, what’s going through your mind in those moments? Are you actively trying to push the thought away, or does it feel like it's just… there?
User: I try to push it away, but it just keeps coming back. It’s like I’m wrestling with something invisible. And then I just get more frustrated, which makes it even worse. It's a vicious cycle, I guess.
User: You've accurately described it – a vicious cycle of escalating anxiety, followed by a futile attempt to suppress the thoughts, which only fuels the cycle further. That's a really insightful observation, and it highlights the importance of shifting our approach. Instead of trying to push the thoughts away, which is often a counterproductive strategy, let's consider exploring ways to notice them without getting completely overwhelmed. Would you be open to trying a brief mindfulness exercise with me, just to practice that skill of noticing without judgment?
User: I... I don’t know. It sounds hard.
User: It can feel challenging at first, but it’s a skill that develops with practice, and it can be incredibly helpful in managing these intense feelings. We don’t have to do anything formal or complicated, just a simple technique to bring you back to the present moment. It might be easier to start with just recognizing the feeling of wanting to push the thought away – that's a signal that you're noticing the cycle starting. Could you just give me a rating

### Session 012 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** fear of losing control or going crazy, difficulty falling or staying asleep, panic attacks with intense fear
- **Cognitive Distortion:** labeling self as defective or broken
- **Emotional Presentation:** hopeful but uncertain
- **Therapy Goal:** just function day-to-day better
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   What's been hardest is fear of losing control or going crazy for a few weeks. It started after family conflict or estrangement. Difficulty falling or staying asleep.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a really intense period, and the fear of losing control and going crazy is a powerful and unsettling feeling. I hear you're connecting this to recent family conflict and the trouble with sleep – those are significant stressors. It’s completely understandable that this combination would be triggering. Could you tell me a little more about the specific thoughts you’re having when you feel like you’re losing control, perhaps describing one instance that stands out?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.99), `abstracting` (0.79), `emotion_characterizing` (0.13)

3. **Client:**
   It's just… a lot. Like, if I don't think about it, it's okay, but the second I even *consider* it, it just… explodes. It's like a pressure cooker building, and then bam, it just spills over. I don't know what I'll do if it does, though.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `counterfactual_reasoning` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That "pressure cooker" feeling you're describing is incredibly relatable; it's as if these thoughts and emotions are building up and then suddenly erupting. It makes perfect sense that you'd feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do when that happens. Perhaps we could explore what kinds of thoughts or situations tend to trigger this buildup and release – are there specific themes or scenarios that seem to precede the "explosion"?  It’s okay if you don’t have a clear answer; the very act of noticing these patterns can be helpful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_management` (0.18)

5. **Client:**
   It's hard to say, really. It’s mostly when I'm alone. Just...thinking. Or when I see something small, like a stain on the carpet, and suddenly I'm thinking about all the other things that could go wrong, all the things I'm failing at. It’s like my brain just…loops.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like when you're alone and allowed to think, your mind has a tendency to gravitate towards worst-case scenarios and past perceived failures, creating a cycle of negative thoughts. This tendency to loop and focus on potential problems when you're alone is something many people experience, especially when feeling vulnerable. Have you noticed any particular emotions, like anxiety or sadness, that seem to fuel this looping process? Would you be open to experimenting with a simple grounding technique, like the 5-4-3-2-1 method, when you feel this starting to happen?

7. **Client:**
   Sadness, definitely. And guilt. It feels like I’ve messed everything up, constantly. I just… I want to disappear sometimes.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.64)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   I hear you saying that you feel like you’ve messed everything up, and that desire to disappear is a really powerful and concerning feeling. That sense of guilt and sadness is also deeply connected to those negative thoughts about yourself and your past. It takes courage to share that vulnerability with me, and I appreciate you opening up about wanting to disappear – it’s a sign that you’re struggling significantly.  Let’s take a moment to acknowledge that feeling – it’s okay to feel this way, and you're not alone in experiencing these intense emotions. 

To help us understand this further, could you tell me more about what specifically feels like "messing everything up"? Is there a particular event or pattern of events that you’re focusing on when you feel this way?

### Session 013 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** fear of losing control or going crazy, hypervigilance and startling easily, rapid heartbeat and chest discomfort
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** agitated and restless
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I don't understand why fear of losing control or going crazy for several months. It started after death of a loved one. Hypervigilance and startling easily.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly distressing to be experiencing this fear of losing control and going crazy, especially following the loss of a loved one. The hypervigilance and easy startle responses are significant and understandably impacting your daily life. You're describing a very real and unsettling experience.  Could you tell me a little more about what typically triggers these moments of intense fear or panic?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   It’s just…everything. It feels like if I don’t pay attention to every little detail, something terrible is going to happen. Like if I leave the house and don't check the locks three times, something awful will definitely happen to my family. It’s exhausting.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `zooming_in` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (0.97)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight, feeling completely responsible for preventing harm to your family, and that’s exhausting beyond words. The feeling that needing to meticulously check everything is linked to this profound fear suggests a strong need for safety and control, which makes perfect sense given the recent loss you've experienced.  What do you think is at the root of this intense need for control, do you believe it's connected to the fear of the loss you've suffered?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   I don’t know. It feels like I have to be in charge of everything, otherwise, things will fall apart and...and everyone will be hurt. It's like, if I'm not actively preventing it, it's going to happen. Maybe it's because when my mom died, it felt like everything just...disappeared.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `analyzing` (0.91)

6. **Therapist:**
   It’s understandable to feel this way; the image of everything dissolving like your mother's passing is incredibly painful and creates a deep sense of vulnerability.  The feeling that you must be the anchor, preventing chaos, is a natural response to such a significant loss, and it’s a way of trying to regain some control in a world that suddenly feels unstable.  Perhaps we could explore how this tendency to be ‘in charge’ has shown up in your life before this recent experience?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `analogical_thinking` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I don’t know… my mom was pretty…strict. She always had to know where I was. I guess I just…learned that’s how it was done.

User: That’s a really significant piece of information. It sounds like you've internalized a pattern of control from your own upbringing, where

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   You're absolutely right. It sounds like you've internalized a pattern of control from your own upbringing, where your mother’s need for certainty and her focus on safety may have inadvertently shaped your own approach to life. It's not necessarily your fault that you’ve adopted this way of being; sometimes, we learn behaviors from those closest to us, even if they aren’t helpful for us in the long run. Can you recall specific examples of how this manifested when you were growing up?

### Session 014 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feeling numb or emotionally detached, thoughts of death or self-harm, social withdrawal and isolation, significant changes in appetite and weight
- **Cognitive Distortion:** labeling self as defective or broken
- **Emotional Presentation:** emotionally flat and detached
- **Therapy Goal:** rebuild confidence and self-worth
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   People tell me feeling numb or emotionally detached for six months or more. It started after academic pressure and performance anxiety. Thoughts of death or self-harm.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly distressing to be experiencing this numbness and detachment for such a sustained period, particularly following the intense pressure of academic life and the accompanying anxiety. It takes courage to share these difficult thoughts of death and self-harm – thank you for bringing them to our session. Can you tell me a little more about what these feelings of numbness actually *feel* like for you, and what kinds of activities or situations seem to trigger or exacerbate them?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   It’s… hard to describe, really. It's like everything is muted, like watching a movie through a really thick pane of glass. I know things are happening, people are talking, but it doesn’t really register, it just kind of washes over me. Sometimes I feel guilty for not feeling anything, like I *should* be upset or sad, but I just... don't.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That "muted" experience sounds profoundly isolating – it's understandable that you’d find that difficult to describe. It’s really brave of you to acknowledge the internal conflict of feeling guilt for not feeling what you think you ‘should’ feel. What do you imagine it would look like if you *could* fully feel the emotions you believe you’re supposed to be feeling?  Perhaps exploring that imagined feeling could help us understand what’s missing.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_organizing` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   Honestly, I don’t know. It feels… distant. Like I'm looking at a painting of sadness, but I don't actually understand what it is, or why it's there. There's this expectation, like I should be weeping or raging, but there’s just… nothing. It's scary, because I feel like if I could just *feel* something, then I’d know what to do, or how to fix it, but I don't.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `suspending_judgment` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (0.96)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re describing a significant disconnect between your expectations of how you *should* be feeling and the actual experience of numbness, creating a really difficult and unsettling inner landscape. The image of the "painting of sadness" is a powerful metaphor – it perfectly captures this sense of observing emotions without truly experiencing them. What do you think might be contributing to this disconnect, considering the initial trigger of academic pressure and anxiety?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `meta_awareness` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (0.85), `evaluating` (0.82), `response_modulation` (0.79), `noticing` (0.18)

7. **Client:**
   I think... it's like I tried to shut everything down. When things got too overwhelming, I just stopped. Like I was building a wall around myself, and now it's just... there. It feels like protecting myself, but it’s also incredibly lonely.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `analyzing` (0.10)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really insightful observation. It sounds like you developed a protective mechanism – a wall – to cope with intense pressure, and that wall inadvertently became a barrier to feeling anything at all. It makes sense that building a wall might feel protective, especially when you were experiencing such overwhelming anxiety. Can you tell me more about when you first started to construct this wall? Were there specific events or moments that led you to feel the need to create this distance?
User: I think… it started around the time I was working on my thesis. It just got… relentless. The deadlines, the expectations, the feeling that I had to be perfect. It felt like if I didn't get it right, everything would fall apart. Then, suddenly, I just stopped caring. Not about the thesis, not about anything. It was like a switch flipped, and everything became gray.
User: So, the thesis, and the associated pressure to be perfect, served as a catalyst for this protective mechanism. It’s incredibly common to respond to overwhelming stress with withdrawal – it’s a natural, albeit often maladaptive, reaction.  You mentioned that things became “gray” – can you elaborate on what that feels like, beyond just the numbness?  Are there any particular sensations or thoughts that accompany that grayness?
User: It’s… just emptiness, mostly. A lack of color, like everything's washed out. And a constant, low-level hum of worry, like a refrigerator running in the background. It's not a specific fear, just this persistent feeling that something bad is about to happen, even if I don't know what.
User: The "emptiness" and the "hum of worry" paint a very clear picture of this grayness – it's not just a lack of feeling, but a feeling of impending threat. That persistent worry, even without a specific trigger, is a significant factor.  It seems like this wall isn’t just shielding you from intense pressure, but also from potential threats and anxieties.  Do you think this wall might be preventing you from accessing other, potentially more helpful, coping strategies?
User: Maybe. I don’t know. It feels… safe, in a way. Even if it’s lonely. I’m afraid of what would happen if I took it down. What if everything falls apart?
User: It's completely understandable that you’re hesitant to dismantle a system that, even if it’

### Session 015 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** social withdrawal and isolation, persistent sadness and emptiness
- **Cognitive Distortion:** all-or-nothing thinking
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** stop negative thought patterns
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   What's been hardest is social withdrawal and isolation for several months. It started after failure or major disappointment. Persistent sadness and emptiness.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly difficult to be withdrawing from social connections and experiencing such persistent sadness and emptiness after a significant setback. That sense of isolation can really amplify these feelings, making them feel even more intense. It's brave of you to share this – often, it’s hard to reach out when we're feeling this way. What do you think triggered the initial disappointment or failure that you mentioned, and how has it shaped your feelings of isolation since then?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I don't know where to start, really. I lost my job. A good one, too. I was a graphic designer, and they just...downsized. It felt like a punch to the gut, like everything I’d been working towards, just gone. Now, I just feel like I’m failing at everything, and everyone’s judging me.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It’s completely understandable that losing a job, especially one you valued, would feel like such a devastating blow and trigger those intense feelings of failure and judgment. It’s incredibly painful to have invested so much energy and passion into something that suddenly disappears. You're giving yourself permission to feel the impact of this loss – that's a really important step. Could you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like everyone is judging you right now?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.12)

5. **Client:**
   I just...I feel like they're seeing that I don't have a job, and they’re thinking, “What’s wrong with him? Why can’t he hold down a job?” It's stupid, I know, but it's like I'm constantly broadcasting my failure to everyone I meet. And I don't want to talk about it; it feels too shameful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `applying` (0.21)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of perceived judgment, interpreting everyone's reactions as evidence of criticism and disapproval. That feeling of broadcasting your failure, even if it's not intentional, is incredibly distressing. You're absolutely right to acknowledge that it *feels* shameful, and that's often a sign that you're deeply sensitive to how you're perceived. Have you noticed any specific patterns in the situations where you feel this judgment most acutely, and what are you imagining that people are thinking in those moments?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I guess so. It feels...embarrassing. Like I’m letting myself down. And if I admit I’m struggling, then it's like I'm confirming that I'm not capable anymore. It's easier to just pretend it didn't happen and avoid the awkwardness.
User: That's a very valid and understandable response. It makes sense that acknowledging your loss and admitting you're struggling would feel uncomfortable and even a bit threatening to your self-image. It sounds like there's a fear of confirming a belief about not being capable anymore. It’s
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.98), `emotion_receiving` (0.93)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That's a really good observation. It seems like you’re protecting yourself from feeling like a failure by avoiding the situation altogether. It's like you're trying to control how others perceive you, but it’s actually fueling the anxiety and the sense of shame. Would you say that this avoidance is a way of managing the pain, even if it's not a healthy one in the long run?
User: Yeah, I guess so. It just feels...easier. Like if I don’t talk about it, it doesn't *really* happen. It’s a weird thought, I know. But I just don't want to feel *that* bad.
User: That’s a completely understandable desire to avoid intense feelings—it's a very common coping mechanism. It’s like you’re trying to diminish the reality of the situation by telling yourself it doesn’t “really” happen.  Can you tell me a little more about what "feeling that bad" looks like for you? What specific emotions come up when you allow yourself to think about the job loss and the impact it’s having?
User: It's… overwhelming. Just this heavy sadness, like a weight on my chest. And then I get really angry, like it's not fair. And then I feel useless, like I’m just a burden to everyone. It spirals.
User: Okay, so you’re experiencing a complex mix of sadness, anger, and feelings of uselessness – that’s a lot to carry. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant emotional intensity when you confront these thoughts and feelings. It makes sense that it “spirals” because those emotions are powerfully connected. Let's talk a little bit about that anger – where do you think that anger is coming from? Is it directed at the company that let you go, or is it more about something else entirely?
User: Mostly at myself, I think. I feel like I should have done something differently. Like I wasn’t trying hard enough, or I wasn’t good enough. It’s all my fault.
User: It’s incredibly common to turn that self-blame inward, especially in situations like this. It’s often a way of trying to regain a sense of control when things feel chaotic and uncertain. You're essentially telling yourself that if you could just be *different*, then things would be okay. Let's explore

- **Primary Symptoms:** restlessness and feeling on edge, overwhelming dread about the future, avoidance of triggering situations
- **Cognitive Distortion:** fortune telling (predicting negative outcomes)
- **Emotional Presentation:** frustrated and angry
- **Therapy Goal:** feel like myself again
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I don't understand why really struggling. Restlessness and feeling on edge and overwhelming dread about the future. It's been a few weeks since health diagnosis or chronic illness.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight right now, feeling restless and on edge with a persistent sense of dread as you navigate this new health diagnosis. It makes complete sense that you’d be struggling – dealing with a significant change like this can be incredibly overwhelming. I hear you saying you feel like you don't understand why you're experiencing this level of distress. Could you tell me a little more about what specifically about the future feels most daunting?

3. **Client:**
   It’s just… everything. I guess? Like, I used to be able to plan things, you know? Even small things – a weekend trip, a dinner with friends. Now, it feels pointless. I feel like if I even *think* about making plans, it’s just going to fall apart, and I'll be stuck dealing with everything else on top of that. I don't know if I can even handle it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `understanding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like this diagnosis has really shaken your sense of control and predictability, and that’s a really understandable reaction. The thought of planning, which used to bring you joy and structure, now feels fraught with anxiety and the potential for disappointment – that’s a significant shift. You’re experiencing a profound sense of loss, it sounds like, of a former self and the ease with which you used to manage your life.  What do you notice about the thoughts that come up when you start to consider making a plan?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (0.25)

5. **Client:**
   Mostly just…panic. Like, if I even try to book a train ticket, I'm going to get sick. Or I'll need to cancel everything because I'm not well enough. It’s like my body is already bracing for the worst, and I don’t know how to stop it. I feel like a failure, honestly; I can’t even do something as simple as book a train ticket.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It's clear that these panic responses are intensely distressing and are hijacking your ability to even engage in simple activities. It sounds like your body is reacting as if it's already experiencing the negative outcome you're fearing, and that feeling of being a "failure" is a painful judgment. Perhaps we can explore what’s fueling those expectations of illness and cancellation? Have you noticed any particular thoughts that immediately precede the panic when considering a plan like booking a train ticket?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `counterfactual_reasoning` (0.60)

7. **Client:**
   I think… I think I expect it to go wrong. Always. Like, it’s just a matter of *when*, not *if*. I don’t know why I think that, but it's just… there. It’s like a dark cloud hanging over everything.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That "dark cloud" you describe – the expectation that things will inevitably go wrong – sounds like a really persistent and difficult thought pattern. It's understandable that this would lead to anxiety and avoidance. Let's dig a little deeper into where that expectation might be coming from.  Can you recall a time in the past, perhaps a childhood experience, when something similar happened and you felt let down or disappointed? Don’t worry about making it perfect or a complete story; just whatever comes to mind.
User: When I was little, my dad promised he’d take me to the zoo. He said he’d pick me up at seven, and I waited until eight. He just...didn't show up. I was so upset, and he said he was sorry, but it didn’t really matter. It just felt like he didn't care about keeping his promises. That's probably why I'm like this, isn't it?
User: That’s a really significant experience to carry with you, and it makes perfect sense that it would shape your expectations about others’ reliability. It’s incredibly painful when someone you trust, especially a parent, breaks a promise, and your reaction – feeling deeply hurt and invalidated – is completely understandable. It’s not surprising that you've developed a tendency to anticipate disappointment and that your relationship with promises has become tinged with anxiety. Do you see any parallels between that childhood experience and how you're feeling now about planning and making commitments?
User: Yeah… I guess so. It's like I’m waiting for the disappointment to happen, and it always does. It's exhausting. It feels like I’m constantly bracing myself for something to go wrong, and I'm never actually enjoying anything because I’m always worried about it being ruined.
User: It sounds like you’ve built a protective mechanism—a way to anticipate and avoid potential pain—but it’s unfortunately also preventing you from experiencing joy and connection. You're essentially living in a state of preemptive distress, constantly guarding yourself against disappointment. Recognizing this pattern is a really important first step.  Let’s talk about how we might gently start to challenge that automatic expectation that things *will* go wrong. Would you be open to experimenting with a small, low-stakes plan – something very manageable – and noticing your thoughts and feelings as you go?
User: Okay… maybe. I don’t know. It feels

### Session 017 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** extreme fatigue and lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feeling numb or emotionally detached
- **Cognitive Distortion:** all-or-nothing thinking
- **Emotional Presentation:** emotionally flat and detached
- **Therapy Goal:** rebuild confidence and self-worth
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I don't understand why really struggling. Extreme fatigue and lack of energy and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. It's been six months or more since trauma or past abuse resurfacing.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of distress and confusion, feeling overwhelmed by this persistent fatigue, lack of energy, and difficulty focusing. It makes perfect sense that these symptoms are surfacing alongside the resurfacing of past trauma after six months.  Could you tell me more about what feels the most challenging about this fatigue—is it a physical sensation, or does it feel more like an emotional exhaustion?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (0.99), `hypothesis_generation` (0.25)

3. **Client:**
   It feels… heavy. Like a weight I can't shake off, but I don't know if it’s *really* a weight, or if I'm just catastrophizing again. Like maybe it's just laziness, or that I’m failing at everything, and I'm just making it worse by thinking these things.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `response_modulation` (0.78)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're grappling with a really difficult and painful experience—this feeling of a "heavy" weight, coupled with the worry that it might be simply self-criticism. It's understandable to question your perceptions when you’re going through such intense emotions, and your awareness of potentially catastrophic thinking is a good sign.  Have you noticed any specific thoughts or situations that tend to trigger these feelings of inadequacy or “laziness”?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   Yeah, lately it's been anything involving plans. Just thinking about making a grocery list, or even replying to a text message... it feels like a massive effort. Like I'm just... draining all my energy just to do the simplest things. And then I beat myself up for not doing them, and it just gets worse.

6. **Therapist:**
   It’s clear that even seemingly small activities are feeling incredibly draining and triggering a cycle of self-criticism, which is understandably causing you to feel worse. This creates a very challenging feedback loop, doesn't it? What do you think is at the root of this disproportionate impact of simple tasks – do you feel like it's directly related to the trauma, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.97)

7. **Client:**
   I… I think it’s connected to the trauma, honestly. It’s like, if I have to *do* anything, anything at all, it just feels like I’m reliving it. Like I'm being forced to face something scary, and the energy it takes to do it is just… consuming. But then, if I don’t do it, I feel guilty and like I'm letting things fall apart, so it’s a horrible cycle.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `understanding` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `remembering` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   You’ve shared a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to delve into these difficult memories. It takes a lot of courage to revisit those experiences, and it’s understandable that it feels overwhelming. When you experience the tightness in your chest and the shaking hands while making a grocery list, what kinds of thoughts or images come to mind? Don't censor yourself – just let whatever comes to your mind flow out.
User: It’s… hard to say. It’s like flashes of… being trapped. Like I was in a small room, and the door was locked, and I couldn’t get out. And I was completely alone, and everyone was just… watching. It’s not a specific event, it’s more of a feeling – a sense of being trapped and utterly helpless. It's brief, but intense.
User: Those flashes of being trapped and utterly helpless sound incredibly distressing, and it’s clear that those sensations are deeply connected
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.95), `convergent_thinking` (0.55), `emotion_perception` (0.30), `zooming_in` (0.26)

### Session 018 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** thoughts of death or self-harm, physical aches and pains with no clear cause
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** exhausted and defeated
- **Therapy Goal:** repair damaged relationships
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I'm here because of thoughts of death or self-harm. This has been going on for as long as I can remember, ever since chronic work stress and burnout. I've tried journaling and self-reflection, but nothing helps.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight, feeling these persistent thoughts of death and self-harm since childhood, stemming from that prolonged period of work stress and burnout. That’s incredibly difficult to cope with, and it’s brave of you to reach out for support.  It’s understandable that journaling and self-reflection haven't been effective – those tools aren't always a quick fix for deeply ingrained experiences.  Could you tell me a little more about what specifically about these thoughts feels most overwhelming or distressing right now?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   They just... they just feel like they're always there. Like a dark cloud hanging over everything. Even when I’m doing something I enjoy, I still feel this pull, this urge to just… not be. And it's not like they're constant, like, I won't have a good day, but it's always lurking beneath the surface, ready to pop up.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `abstracting` (0.99), `evaluating` (0.54)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like this persistent feeling of a “dark cloud” is a really accurate way to describe how these thoughts are affecting you – they’re not just appearing sporadically, but constantly coloring your experience, even during moments of joy. That feeling of being perpetually on edge, with the urge to ‘not be’ always lurking, is understandably exhausting.  When you experience that shift from a good day to this underlying sense of pull, what do you think might be triggering that change, even subtly?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (0.84)

5. **Client:**
   The chest tightness is probably an 8. The shaking is a 7. My stomach is a 6. And the paralysis... probably a 9.
User: Thank you for being so honest about those intensities – it’s valuable information to have. A 9
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `remembering` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.96)

6. **Therapist:**
   You’re welcome. It takes a lot of courage to articulate those intense physical sensations, and acknowledging them is a really important step. The sheer intensity you're describing—the chest tightness, the shaking, the stomach distress, and particularly the paralysis—suggests that your body is experiencing a significant level of stress response.  It seems like these physical symptoms might be disproportionate to the immediate trigger, could you perhaps describe what usually precedes the onset of these sensations?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   It's… me. I’m stuck with *myself*. With all this darkness.
User: “Stuck with yourself and all this darkness”—that's a really poignant and vulnerable way to describe it. It sounds like you're carrying a deep sense of self-criticism and a feeling of being burdened by your own internal state. This feeling of being "stuck with yourself" suggests that you’re struggling to accept
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `reframing` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `questioning` (0.75)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   It’s difficult to say precisely what’s triggering that shift, but the timing of the intensification of these physical symptoms alongside your feelings of self-criticism and the darkness suggests a possible connection. Have you noticed a pattern, perhaps a specific situation or thought that consistently precedes these moments?
User: I don't know. Sometimes it’s just… silence. Or being alone. Just… me and my thoughts.
User: Silence and solitude can be really challenging, especially when you're grappling with these intense internal experiences. It’s understandable that being alone with your thoughts amplifies those feelings of darkness and self-criticism. Let’s explore that a little bit—when you’re alone with your thoughts, what kinds of thoughts are typically present?
User: Mostly just... that I’m a failure. That I’ll never be good enough. And that everyone is judging me, even if they aren’t.
User: Those are really tough thoughts to carry—the feeling of being a failure, never being good enough, and the fear of judgment. It’s clear that these are deeply ingrained beliefs contributing to your distress. Do you feel like these thoughts are based on something concrete, or do they feel more like automatic, almost compulsive, reactions to situations?
User: Concrete... maybe. Like, my job. It’s just… overwhelming. And I keep making mistakes. And people notice.
User: So, the overwhelming nature of your job, combined with perceived mistakes and the feeling that others are observing and judging you, is feeding into those negative beliefs. It's not surprising that this is a significant trigger for your distress, considering the ongoing stress and burnout you described earlier. Let's try a small exercise. Could you tell me about a recent situation at work that felt particularly challenging, and describe what went through your mind at that time?
User: Okay. Yesterday, I had to present a report. And I completely blanked. Just… froze. I could feel everyone staring at me, and I just started sweating. It was awful.
User: That sounds incredibly frightening—the feeling of freezing up in front of others, the sensation of being stared at, and the physical reaction of sweating. It’s a really common fear, and the intensity of your experience speaks to how much this situation matters to you. It seems like presenting, or being in a situation where you feel evaluated, is a significant source of anxiety for you. Can you describe what

### Session 019 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** social withdrawal and isolation, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** confused and disoriented
- **Therapy Goal:** manage anxiety and worry better
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for six months or more. I'm dealing with social withdrawal and isolation, especially after financial difficulties and instability. I really want to manage anxiety and worry better.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy load for quite some time, and it makes perfect sense that you’re experiencing such profound difficulties with social withdrawal and worry after navigating financial challenges. I hear a lot of sadness and frustration in your voice, and it’s courageous of you to acknowledge these feelings.  Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers your anxiety when you think about the financial situation, and what thoughts tend to run through your mind?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `concretizing` (0.71)

3. **Client:**
   It's just...everything. It feels like if I can't keep a job, or if I lose everything, then I’m worthless. I keep thinking about ending up on the streets, completely alone. It's hard to even leave the house sometimes because of that, you know?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds incredibly distressing to be holding onto those persistent, and frankly, quite frightening thoughts – the fear of losing everything and ending up alone.  It's completely understandable why that would lead to social withdrawal and difficulty leaving the house, given how much it's impacting your sense of self-worth.  You're experiencing a significant level of anxiety, and it’s valid that you’re struggling with this. I notice you’re highlighting the potential for a very bleak outcome; could you tell me, when you imagine yourself on the streets, what part of that scenario feels most unbearable, and what needs of yours aren’t being met in that imagined reality?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   The worst part is the feeling of not being seen, I think. Like no one would even notice if I disappeared. And I don’t need food or shelter, those are basic things I could probably figure out. It’s the loneliness, the absolute, crushing loneliness.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.85)

6. **Therapist:**
   It resonates deeply that the feeling of not being seen, of invisibility, is the core of this distress, particularly alongside that overwhelming sense of loneliness.  You're describing a fundamental human need – connection – that you’re experiencing as acutely absent, and it’s understandable why that would trigger such a profound fear. Perhaps we could explore what might be contributing to this feeling of invisibility, and how it connects to your experiences with social withdrawal? Is there a past experience that colors your current perception of how others might respond to you?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `creating` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (0.88)

7. **Client:**
   Yeah, I guess so. I tend to downplay my own needs and opinions, you know? Like, I don't want to bother anyone. And I definitely don't want to be the center of attention. It’s exhausting, but also… familiar.
User: That’s a really insightful observation – recognizing that this pattern of downplaying your needs and avoiding the spotlight is, in many ways, a learned behavior stemming from those childhood experiences. It makes complete sense that it would feel “familiar,” even if it's exhausting. It’s a protective mechanism, a way of trying to avoid the discomfort of potential disappointment or rejection. Let's explore that a bit further. When you say you don’t want to ‘bother’ people, what specifically are you afraid of happening if you express a need or an
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `reframing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (0.99)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   Do you mean if you ask for help, or if you share something about yourself?
User: Both, I think. It's just... the thought of someone saying no, or worse, judging me. It’s like, if I’m vulnerable, then I'm just asking to be hurt.
User: That's a really powerful and painful thought - the belief that vulnerability automatically leads to hurt. It’s a very common experience, and it's understandable that you’re holding yourself back out of fear. It sounds like you're connecting vulnerability with a potential for rejection or judgment, and that’s creating a significant barrier to seeking support. Could you tell me a little bit more about when you've experienced this in the past – a specific instance that might have reinforced this belief?
User: When I was a kid, my mom would always tell me to be quiet and not make a fuss. If I cried, she’d just tell me to stop it and that I was being dramatic. It wasn’t that she was mean, exactly, but she just…didn't seem to want to deal with my feelings. It made me feel like my feelings were a burden.
User: That’s incredibly painful to hear, and it’s no wonder you’ve developed this belief that vulnerability is a burden. Your mother’s response – minimizing your emotions and essentially invalidating your feelings – has likely deeply ingrained the idea that expressing your needs and emotions is something to be avoided. It’s a natural response to feeling unsupported and unseen as a child. I want to acknowledge how difficult it must have been to carry that weight alone.

It's helpful to understand how those early experiences shaped your perception of connection and vulnerability. Would you be willing to explore how those patterns might be playing out in your current relationships, and perhaps identify some small, manageable steps you could take to challenge this belief?
User: I don’t know… it feels hard. Like, I’ve been doing this for so long, it’s just… ingrained. I’m afraid of disrupting things, even if they’re not good.
User: It’s completely understandable that it feels challenging – these ingrained patterns are incredibly difficult to shift, and the fear of disrupting the status quo, even if it's an uncomfortable one, is a very natural response. You’re protecting yourself, and that's valid. However, staying stuck in a pattern that’s

### Session 020 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** extreme fatigue and lack of energy, thoughts of death or self-harm
- **Cognitive Distortion:** should statements and rigid rules
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** manage anxiety and worry better
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I keep thinking about really struggling. Extreme fatigue and lack of energy and thoughts of death or self-harm. It's been two to three months since failure or major disappointment.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a tremendous weight right now – the exhaustion, the lack of energy, and those difficult thoughts. That's a really brave thing to share, and I want you to know you’re not alone in experiencing these feelings. It takes strength to even acknowledge them.  Can you tell me a little more about what specifically triggered that initial "failure or major disappointment" and how it's been impacting your daily life?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (0.11)

3. **Client:**
   It’s… hard to talk about. It’s not one single thing, really. It was the job. I applied for this promotion, and I didn't get it. Everyone else seemed so much more qualified, so much more… competent. I feel like I’m just failing at everything, and it’s just going to keep happening.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It’s completely understandable that this is difficult to talk about, and it’s incredibly painful to feel like you’re failing, especially when comparing yourself to others. The feeling of inadequacy you’re describing, seeing others as more competent, is a very common experience during setbacks, and it can really fuel those negative thought patterns.  Perhaps you could describe what "failing at everything" looks like in your day-to-day routine - are there specific activities or areas where you feel this most acutely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   I don’t really *do* anything. Like, I used to enjoy going for walks, reading, painting. Now, I just lie on the couch and stare at the TV. I can't even bring myself to pick up my paints. It feels pointless, like any effort I make will just be wasted. I just want to disappear, honestly.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re retreating into a space of stillness, which is understandable given the intensity of what you're experiencing – wanting to simply disappear is a powerful signal of overwhelming distress. It’s heartbreaking to hear you’ve lost the enjoyment in activities you once loved and that the thought of effort feels utterly pointless right now. Could you tell me what thoughts are going through your mind when you're lying on the couch, observing the TV? Are there specific worries or regrets that keep returning?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.99), `abstracting` (0.50)

7. **Client:**
   Mostly just… what's the point? Why even bother trying? I keep thinking I’m a burden to everyone. I don't deserve happiness, and it's probably better this way, just to… end it. It just feels easier than fighting.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a very raw and honest expression, and I appreciate you sharing those thoughts with me, even though they're incredibly painful. Hearing you say that you feel like a burden and that you don’t deserve happiness is deeply concerning, and I want to assure you that those feelings don't reflect reality. Let’s unpack those thoughts a bit. When you say you "don't deserve happiness," where do you think that belief comes from? Is there a specific time or experience that shaped that feeling?
User: I don’t… I don’t know. My dad was always so critical. He never said anything nice, and he always pointed out my mistakes, big and small. It just… feels like that’s how everyone is, that people are just going to be disappointed.
User: It’s completely understandable that your father's critical nature would have a lasting impact on your self-perception and how you relate to others. The constant criticism can really erode self-esteem and create a deep-seated belief that you're not worthy of love or acceptance. It’s a common experience to internalize the negativity of a critical caregiver. Do you think you’re carrying over that pattern into your relationships with others, perhaps unconsciously expecting disappointment or criticism?
User: Yeah, I think so. I avoid getting close to people because I’m afraid they’ll see me the way my dad did. It's exhausting just trying to be "good enough." I keep setting myself up for failure, and then I beat myself up about it. It’s a cycle.
User: That makes a lot of sense – it’s incredibly wise of you to recognize that pattern. You're essentially protecting yourself from potential pain by creating distance and holding yourself to an impossibly high standard. You’re right, it *is* a cycle, and it's often one we create without even realizing it.  Can you think of a small, manageable step you could take this week, even if it feels incredibly difficult, that might help you disrupt that cycle of self-criticism and avoidance?
User: I… I don’t know. Maybe just… open a book? But what if I don’t like it? What if I just waste time? That’s the thing, I always seem to find a reason not to do something.
User: It's perfectly valid to feel hesitant – those "what ifs" are a very common way to

### Session 021 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feeling numb or emotionally detached, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, extreme fatigue and lack of energy
- **Cognitive Distortion:** overgeneralizing from single events
- **Emotional Presentation:** anxious and hypervigilant
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I've been feeling feeling numb or emotionally detached for as long as I can remember. It started after parenting challenges and feeling overwhelmed. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy weight for a long time, and it’s incredibly difficult to describe that sense of numbness and detachment. It’s understandable that the parenting challenges and feeling overwhelmed contributed to this, as those are significant stressors.  Have you noticed any particular times of day or situations when this feeling of numbness is most pronounced?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `noticing` (0.98)

3. **Client:**
   It's… it's hard to say. It’s pretty constant, really, like a dull ache under everything else. But it's worse in the mornings, I think. Just… getting out of bed feels impossible, and like nothing matters. </h1>
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (0.98), `reconsidering` (0.72)

4. **Therapist:**
   It resonates that mornings feel particularly challenging, and that underlying dull ache is persistent – that must feel incredibly exhausting.  The feeling that "nothing matters" can be a really disheartening signal, signaling a deep sense of disconnection.  Could you tell me a bit more about what contributes to that feeling of hopelessness when you wake up, specifically?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (0.48)

5. **Client:**
   Just… that everyone would think I'm a bad mother. That I don’t care. That I'm incapable. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, but I always fall short.  It’s exhausting, and I just want to hide. </h1>
User: Those thoughts— “everyone would think I’m a bad mother, that I don’t care, that I’m incapable”— those are really powerful and difficult to hold, and it’s completely valid that they’re causing you to want to hide. It sounds like you're operating under a lot of pressure to be "perfect," and that’s a very common experience with depression and anxiety. Let’s talk about this pressure you’re feeling. Can you describe what that “perfect mother” looks like to you? What does that ideal look like?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `concretizing` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `abstracting` (0.98)

6. **Therapist:**
   It’s clear that this image of the “perfect mother” is weighing heavily on you, fueling those feelings of worthlessness and guilt. It’s understandable that striving for an unrealistic standard would be so draining. Perhaps we could examine where this image originated - is it based on your own expectations, or external pressures? To help me understand a bit more, could you describe the source of this expectation— where did this idea of what a "good mother" should be come from?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   That... that they’d get hurt. Or that they’d think I wasn’t capable of protecting them. It’s just… terrifying. It feels like I'm letting them down, and then *she’ll* be disappointed. </h1>
User: Those are very real fears, and it’s brave to acknowledge them. The fear of hurting your children and disappointing your mother is powerfully driving your behavior, and it’s creating a cycle of anxiety and control. Let’s gently challenge that thought a little. You mentioned being afraid they’d think you weren’t capable of protecting them. Do you believe your mother’
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   Do you believe your mother has explicitly told you that you aren't a good mother, or do these feelings stem from your own interpretation of her reactions and expectations?
User: It’s… complicated. She’s always been critical. Never really praised anything I do, just… pointed out what’s wrong. I always felt like I was trying to please her, and failing. Now she's gone, and I feel like I'm failing *again*. </h1>
User: That’s a really painful realization – a long history of critical feedback and a lack of genuine praise can have a deep impact on self-worth. It’s understandable that her absence intensifies those feelings of failure and the urge to try and please her, even though she’s not around to do it. How does this history of criticism shape your interactions with your children now?
User: I… I try to be so careful. I overschedule everything, I hover, I’m constantly checking in on them. I want to make sure they're safe, that they’re happy, that they're *okay*. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m smothering them. </h1>
User: It sounds like you're responding to that critical past with a desire to protect and control, which is a natural response to feeling unsafe. That intense need to ensure their safety and happiness is a way of trying to compensate for the lack of affirmation you received growing up. Let’s explore this a bit further - when you say you’re ‘smothering’ them, what specific behaviors are you engaging in that lead you to that conclusion? 
User: I guess… I’m always asking what they're doing, if they’re having fun, if they need anything. I don’t let them just… *be*. I constantly intervene. I’m afraid if I let go, something bad will happen. </h1>
User: That’s a really insightful observation – a desire to control and protect, driven by the fear of something bad happening, is a common pattern in response to past feeling of lack of control. It’s like you're trying to create a safety net where there wasn’t one before. When you intervene, what is it specifically that you are trying to prevent? 
User: I… I’m afraid they’ll get hurt. Physically. Or emotionally. I just... I don’t want them to get hurt

### Session 022 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** persistent sadness and emptiness, irritability and restlessness
- **Cognitive Distortion:** catastrophizing worst-case scenarios
- **Emotional Presentation:** hopeful but uncertain
- **Therapy Goal:** feel like myself again
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I'm here because of persistent sadness and emptiness. This has been going on for about a month, ever since identity crisis or questioning life purpose. I've tried journaling and self-reflection, but nothing helps.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight of sadness and emptiness, and it’s completely understandable that you're seeking support.  It's really difficult when self-reflection doesn't provide the relief you're hoping for, and I appreciate you sharing this with me.  Could you tell me a little more about what specifically you're questioning about your life purpose – what feels like the core of that uncertainty?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `response_modulation` (0.93), `emotion_perception` (0.84)

3. **Client:**
   I don’t know, really. It’s like… everyone else seems to have a direction, a goal. I’m just… drifting. Like I'm watching my life happen to me instead of living it. It's awful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.98)

4. **Therapist:**
   That sense of drifting and feeling like you're observing your life instead of actively participating in it must be profoundly disheartening. It’s incredibly common to feel this way when grappling with questions about purpose, and the comparison to others can often intensify those feelings.  When you describe "watching your life happen," can you recall a specific instance where you felt this most acutely – something that stood out as a moment where you felt detached?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `zooming_out` (1.00), `meta_awareness` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   There was last week, I went to my cousin’s graduation. Everyone was so happy, celebrating their achievements, and I just… felt numb. Like I was there for show, a polite face. It just made me feel worse, like I'm failing at being a good relative.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `noticing` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like that graduation ceremony highlighted a significant contrast between your internal experience and the outward expressions of joy you observed – a really painful experience, I imagine. It’s brave of you to acknowledge that feeling numb, as it’s a protective mechanism often used when we're struggling to connect with our emotions.  Could you explore the idea of "failing at being a good relative" – what specifically about that role is contributing to this feeling of inadequacy?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   I don't know. I just want to be someone my family likes and respects. Like, if I don’t succeed, then what's the point? It feels like I'm letting them down.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `evaluating` (0.99)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   Avoiding things when they might be disappointing is

### Session 023 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** constant worry and racing thoughts, stomach problems and nausea
- **Cognitive Distortion:** mind reading (assuming others' thoughts)
- **Emotional Presentation:** agitated and restless
- **Therapy Goal:** feel like myself again
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for almost a year. I'm dealing with constant worry and racing thoughts, especially after family conflict or estrangement. I really want to feel like myself again.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy weight for a long time, and it’s incredibly understandable that you’re yearning to feel like yourself again after this prolonged period of struggle. The connection you’re noticing between family conflict and your worry is significant.  Could you tell me more about what "feeling like yourself" looks like for you when you imagine that future?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (0.29)

3. **Client:**
   I don’t know…it’s hard to describe. Like I’m just…hollow. I used to love painting, but now the thought of picking up a brush just fills me with dread. Simple things, like getting out of bed in the morning, feel like a monumental effort.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (0.26)

4. **Therapist:**
   It's incredibly painful to feel so hollow and to experience such a significant shift away from activities you once enjoyed, like painting. The dread you're describing is a common response to prolonged stress and depression, and it’s completely valid that even seemingly simple things feel overwhelming.  It seems like your sense of self has been deeply affected.  What do you think is contributing most to that feeling of dread when you consider painting?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (0.99), `hypothesis_generation` (0.99)

5. **Client:**
   I guess… I keep thinking about how awful it’ll be. That I’ll just make a mess, or that the painting won’t be any good, and then everyone will see how useless I am. It’s like if I fail at something small, it proves I’m a complete failure.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.97), `emotion_responding` (0.61)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re grappling with some very critical and self-deprecating thoughts—the fear of failure and the belief that it inherently reflects your worth. It’s common to have these kinds of thoughts when feeling depressed, but they're not necessarily true.  Have you noticed any patterns in the kinds of situations where these thoughts tend to surface most strongly?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `updating_beliefs` (0.99), `applying` (0.98)

7. **Client:**
   Honestly, it’s everywhere. Whenever I’m alone, or when I have to make even a small decision, like what to eat. It’s like my brain is constantly judging me and pointing out all the things I’m doing wrong.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `self_questioning` (0.97), `emotion_perception` (0.81)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a really insightful observation. It sounds like you're experiencing a pervasive sense of self-criticism, and it’s not limited to specific situations. It’s almost as if this judgment is always present, acting as a background hum in your mind.  Can you tell me a bit more about where you think this critical voice might have originated?  Where do you think it came from?
User: I don’t know…probably my dad. He was always so disappointed in me, and he always told me I wasn’t good enough. It’s like he’s still here, telling me I’m failing, even though he’s not.
User: It makes a lot of sense that your father’s criticisms would have a lasting impact on you, especially if they were consistent and felt invalidating. It's understandable that you’d carry that voice with you, even in his absence. Have you ever considered how those messages shaped your beliefs about yourself and your abilities?
User: I guess…I always thought I needed to earn my worth through achievement. Like if I could just do enough things right, I’d finally feel okay. It’s exhausting, though. Trying to constantly prove myself.
User: That’s a really important realization—linking your sense of worth to external achievements. It’s a very common trap, striving to earn your self-esteem through external validation. It does sound exhausting, and it's a huge source of pressure.  Do you think there’s a part of you that secretly believes you’re not inherently worthy, even if you’re working incredibly hard?
User: Yeah… I think so. It’s like… even if I accomplish something amazing, I’ll still feel like it’s not enough. Like it’s just a temporary distraction from the fact that I’m fundamentally flawed.
User: That’s a deeply painful thought, and it’s brave of you to acknowledge it. It sounds like there’s a persistent feeling of inadequacy that’s fueling this cycle of striving and disappointment. Would you be willing to explore how that feeling of being “fundamentally flawed” manifests in your thoughts and behaviors?
User: I don’t know how to even start. It just… feels so overwhelming.
User: It’s completely understandable that it feels overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to just breathe and acknowledge that this is a big step. We don

### Session 024 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** irritability and restlessness, difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, significant changes in appetite and weight
- **Cognitive Distortion:** fortune telling (predicting negative outcomes)
- **Emotional Presentation:** agitated and restless
- **Therapy Goal:** repair damaged relationships
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I used to be able to irritability and restlessness for about a month. It started after trauma or past abuse resurfacing. Difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a significant emotional shift, and it’s understandable that you’d be feeling overwhelmed by this combination of irritability, restlessness, and sleep disturbances. The connection to past trauma or abuse resurfacing is a crucial piece of this picture, and it makes sense that these symptoms are emerging. I hear you saying this is impacting your sleep. Can you tell me a little more about what your sleep is actually like - are you struggling to fall asleep, stay asleep, or something else entirely?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I don’t really know how to just… *relax*. It's like my mind is constantly racing, just going over and over things. I keep thinking about the things that happened, and even though I know they’re in the past, it still feels so raw. It’s exhausting, and I just want it to stop, but I don’t know how to make it stop.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight, and it’s completely valid to feel exhausted by the relentless mental activity. The feeling of these past events still feeling raw, even when you acknowledge they’re in the past, is a very common experience when dealing with trauma. You’re experiencing a powerful need for stillness, and it makes sense that this is causing you distress. What specifically are you finding yourself replaying – is there a particular event or a general feeling that’s driving these thoughts?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (1.00), `creating` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `remembering` (1.00), `cognition_awareness` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `emotion_organizing` (1.00), `reframing` (1.00), `self_questioning` (0.55)

5. **Client:**
   It's mostly… the arguments. There was a lot of yelling and it was really scary. I just keep imagining it happening again, and I feel like if I don’t watch myself constantly, it will. I worry I'll do something stupid or say something wrong and it'll start all over. It’s like I’m trapped in a loop.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `attentional_deployment` (0.93)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re experiencing a very distressing loop of memories and anticipatory worry centered around those arguments – they feel incredibly vivid and present, and you’re understandably fearing a recurrence. That sense of being trapped, as if you’re reliving the experience repeatedly, is a really common symptom of trauma and anxiety. Recognizing this pattern is a great first step.  What kind of thoughts are going through your head when you’re imagining it happening again? Perhaps we can explore how those thoughts might be contributing to this feeling of being trapped.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.15)

7. **Client:**
   I guess… it’s like I’m watching myself fail. Like I’m falling apart, piece by piece. It's a slow, painful process.
User: That’s a really evocative image – watching yourself “fall apart, piece by piece.” That’s a lot to experience, and it sounds incredibly distressing. It seems like you're perceiving a sense of disintegration, not just in yourself but in your life. Do you think this feeling of falling
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_receiving` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   It feels like a really vulnerable place to be, to feel like you're breaking down. It's understandable that you’d be so focused on the potential for further “falling apart,” given what you’ve already experienced. When you say you’re watching yourself fail, is there a specific behavior or feeling you’re worried about repeating?
User: Just… everything. I guess. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing, of messing up, of not being good enough. It’s like if I make one mistake, it’s all over. It’s a really overwhelming feeling.
User: The fear of making "one mistake" and having it "all over" – that’s a powerful and understandable fear, particularly given the trauma you’ve described. It sounds like you’re operating under a pretty rigid standard for yourself, almost a perfectionistic one. Would you say that’s accurate?
User: I don’t know. I just… I want things to be okay. I just want it to be over.
User: That simple desire – “I just want things to be okay” – speaks volumes. It's a core human need, and it’s completely valid that you're striving for that, especially after experiencing such difficult things. It’s also understandable that wanting things to be “over” reflects a deep yearning for relief from the intensity of your current experience. Let's try a small exercise: could you describe what “okay” looks like for you in this moment, specifically?
User: I guess… quiet. Just… quiet. No arguing, no yelling, no worry. Just… peace.
User: "Quiet, no arguing, no yelling, no worry, just peace." That’s a beautiful and achievable image—it represents a profound sense of safety and calm. It's clear that you're craving a fundamental shift in your internal landscape. You’ve identified a core need, which is a really important step. Thinking about this "peace" you desire – can you identify any specific activities or thoughts that might bring you even a tiny bit of that feeling, even for a moment?
User: I used to like drawing. When I was a kid, I could just lose myself in it. It was… calming.
User: Drawing… that’s wonderful to remember. It sounds like you discovered a way to access a sense of calm and flow through creative expression as a child. That’s

### Session 025 - ANXIETY

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** difficulty breathing or feeling smothered, overwhelming dread about the future
- **Cognitive Distortion:** fortune telling (predicting negative outcomes)
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** manage anxiety and worry better
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I can't stop worrying about difficulty breathing or feeling smothered for six months or more. It started after caring for aging parents. Overwhelming dread about the future.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden right now, and I hear the significant distress you're experiencing with these persistent worries about breathing and feeling smothered. It makes perfect sense that caring for aging parents would be a massively overwhelming experience, and that's likely a core part of what's fueling these intense feelings. Could you tell me more about what specifically about caring for your parents triggers this feeling of being smothered?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   That's... a lot to unpack. I just feel like I'm failing them, you know? Like, I'm not doing enough, and it’s just going to get worse. It’s like I’m trapped, and I can’t see a way out.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `zooming_out` (0.14)

4. **Therapist:**
   It's understandable to feel so deeply that you’re failing them, and the weight of that feeling is immense. The sense of being trapped, unable to see a way out, is a powerfully distressing experience, and it’s brave of you to share that. When you say you’re not doing enough, can you describe what “enough” looks like to you in this situation?  Perhaps we can explore what’s driving that particular expectation.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   “Enough” would be... them being okay, I guess. Completely independent, healthy, and happy. And me not having to worry about them at all. It feels like if I’m worrying, it means I'm not doing my job.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `accepting` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’ve internalized a really high standard for yourself – a desire for their complete well-being and for your own complete absence of worry, and it's creating a lot of pressure for you.  That's a significant burden to carry, tying your self-worth to their outcomes and your ability to eliminate worry.  What do you think might be contributing to this incredibly high expectation of "enough" – where did this need to be completely independent, healthy, and happy come from?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `evaluating` (0.97)

7. **Client:**
   Honestly, my mom always said, "You have to be strong." Like, just... be strong and everything will be fine. I always took that to mean never showing weakness, never asking for help. It's like I'm trying to live up to this impossible ideal she created.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `analogical_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `noticing` (0.12)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a really insightful connection. It sounds like you've absorbed a very specific message – “be strong, never show weakness” – and it’s shaped your understanding of caregiving and your own role in it. That expectation, combined with her emphasis on strength, has likely led you to believe that showing any vulnerability or needing assistance is a sign of failure. Is it possible that this message, while perhaps intended to be protective, has actually created a lot of pressure and difficulty for you?
User: I guess... yeah. It just feels like if I admit I'm struggling, they’ll think I’m a bad daughter. Or that I can’t handle it. That's what I'm afraid of.
User: So, the fear of judgment and being perceived as inadequate is a very real and understandable reaction, given the message you’ve internalized. It’s not surprising that you're hesitant to ask for help, because admitting you're struggling feels like confirming that you can't live up to this demanding standard. Let’s talk a little more about what specifically you’re worried they’ll think or say if you were to reach out.
User: My dad... he's always been pretty quiet. But when my grandma got sick a few years ago, he just... shut down. Like, he stopped talking to me. It was like I'd done something wrong, even though I was just trying to help. I don’t want that to happen again.
User: That experience with your dad is powerfully evocative, and it clearly demonstrates how your attempts to be strong and independent have had a significant impact on your relationship with him. The way he retreated after your grandmother’s illness suggests that he might be interpreting your caregiving as a challenge to his own role as protector, or perhaps a reflection of his own fear of loss. Do you feel like he's comfortable expressing his needs and concerns, or does he tend to bottle things up like he did then?
User: He does bottle things up. Always has. I just... I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm drowning, and everyone expects me to be the one holding everything together.
User: It’s incredibly challenging to navigate these expectations, particularly when you're feeling overwhelmed and like you’re drowning. You're carrying a tremendous amount of responsibility and striving to meet standards that seem inherently unattainable. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge

### Session 026 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** thoughts of death or self-harm, significant changes in appetite and weight
- **Cognitive Distortion:** personalizing blame for external events
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** rebuild confidence and self-worth
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for as long as I can remember. I'm dealing with thoughts of death or self-harm, especially after death of a loved one. I really want to rebuild confidence and self-worth.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's incredibly brave of you to share this with me. The persistent nature of these feelings and the presence of those thoughts are understandably distressing. It makes a lot of sense that the loss of loved ones would trigger these intense experiences, as grief can significantly impact our sense of self. 

Could you tell me more about what specifically triggers these thoughts of self-harm after a loss?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `questioning` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I don’t know. It’s just… everything feels pointless. Like, if I’m not here, then what was the point of anything I did? And if I’m here, then I'm just stuck, and it's all going to end up the same, eventually. It’s exhausting just thinking about it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (0.90)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a profound sense of hopelessness and a difficulty seeing value in your life, both in the present and in the future. That feeling of being “stuck” and the inevitability of death – it’s completely understandable that this is exhausting for you, especially with the added weight of grief.  It's a very common response to prolonged sadness and loss, feeling like there’s no point to anything.

Perhaps we could explore what “point” means to you in this context, beyond just achievements or external validation.  Would you say there are values or relationships that you feel are important, even if it's hard to fully appreciate them right now?

5. **Client:**
   I don’t know. I just… I don't feel strong. I feel like I’m falling apart. It's hard to think about being strong when I can’t even get out of bed some days.
User: It’s completely understandable to feel
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `questioning` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `reframing` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `understanding` (0.44)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're experiencing a deep sense of vulnerability and a feeling of being overwhelmed by your current state. The struggle to get out of bed speaks volumes about the intensity of the emotions you’re battling—it takes a significant amount of energy just to function.  It's really okay to not feel strong right now, and it's a testament to your willingness to be open about this. 

When you imagine yourself functioning better, even for a small moment, what does that look like? Let's focus on a tiny, achievable step, rather than the big picture.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `concretizing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   My mom... her funeral. Seeing everyone sad. It just… it just feels like it’s never going to end.
User: That’s a profoundly painful memory, and it's understandable that revisiting it would feel overwhelming. It’s not surprising that you’re feeling like it "never going to
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `remembering` (1.00), `emotion_management` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (0.95)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That “emptiness” you describe is a really powerful image. It’s a way of articulating the profound void that’s been created by her absence, and it’s completely valid to feel that way. It’s not just about the sadness of her death, but the disruption to everything—relationships, routines, the sense of completeness—that she represented. 

It seems like this emptiness is tied to a deep fear of disconnection, both from her and from the world around you. Would you be willing to explore that a little further – what does it mean to you to feel disconnected?
User: I don’t know. Like, if she’s not here, then no one is. Like, all the other people are just… going to keep living. They’re not going to feel this, you know? They don’t get it.
User: That's a really difficult feeling to grapple with – the sense of being utterly alone in your grief, as if no one else can possibly understand what you’re experiencing. It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of isolation and invalidation, and it makes perfect sense that this would intensify those feelings of emptiness. 

It’s incredibly painful to feel like your experience is unique and unshared.  Let’s talk a little bit about how this feeling of isolation plays out in your daily life. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you felt particularly disconnected?
User: My friend, Sarah, called. She was just… talking about her weekend. Like, going to a concert and having fun. And I just... shut down. I couldn't even respond. It was like she was speaking a different

### Session 027 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** feeling numb or emotionally detached, extreme fatigue and lack of energy, thoughts of death or self-harm
- **Cognitive Distortion:** emotional reasoning (feelings as facts)
- **Emotional Presentation:** defensive and guarded
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Things haven't been good for almost a year. I'm dealing with feeling numb or emotionally detached, especially after academic pressure and performance anxiety. I really want to understand why this is happening.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, and it’s incredibly frustrating to feel so disconnected from your emotions, particularly when it’s linked to such intense pressure. It makes complete sense that you’d want to understand the root of this numbness – it’s a natural response to prolonged stress. Have you noticed any specific patterns around when this detachment tends to be strongest?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_management` (0.14)

3. **Client:**
   I guess… after exams. Like, as soon as the results are out, it just hits me. It’s like the world just fades away, and I can’t even feel sad or happy about anything. I just feel… empty. It's awful.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `situation_modification` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   That’s a really powerful image – the world fading away, and that sense of emptiness is profoundly difficult to experience. It's understandable that you'd feel awful when something so impactful occurs and it leads to such a strong reaction. Can you tell me more about what you think might be *behind* that feeling of emptiness? Is it a fear of what the results represent, or perhaps a feeling that you’ve somehow failed despite doing your best?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `zooming_out` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   I think... I think it's both, I guess. Like, I always set such high standards for myself, and if I don't get a perfect score, it feels like it’s proof that I'm just not good enough. But then, there’s also this fear that if I *do* get a good score, it'll just mean even more pressure next time, and it won't actually *matter*. It’s exhausting just thinking about it.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_organizing` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `distinguishing` (1.00), `understanding` (1.00), `analyzing` (1.00), `abstracting` (0.99), `emotion_valuing` (0.38)

6. **Therapist:**
   It seems like you're caught in a cycle of striving for perfection alongside a deep fear of falling short, and that’s incredibly exhausting to hold. It's a common experience to tie self-worth to achievement, and the "what if" worries can really amplify the feelings of emptiness. Let’s explore that thought – "I'm not good enough" – could you describe what you're experiencing when you think that, beyond the surface of the words? Perhaps we can start to gently challenge that core belief.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00), `applying` (1.00), `self_questioning` (0.99)

7. **Client:**
   It's just… a really cold feeling, like a tightness in my chest. And I start to see all the things I *didn't* do well, even the small stuff. It's like I'm being judged, constantly. It’s not a nice feeling at all.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `noticing` (0.98)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That "cold feeling" and the focus on the "small stuff" are really important details. It sounds like that feeling is a physical response to a very strong, critical voice within you. It's almost like you’re actively constructing a narrative of failure. When you're experiencing that feeling, what's happening in your body beyond the tightness in your chest? Are there any other sensations, like a quickening heartbeat, muscle tension, or something else?

### Session 028 - DEPRESSION

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, social withdrawal and isolation, irritability and restlessness, feeling numb or emotionally detached
- **Cognitive Distortion:** mind reading (assuming others' thoughts)
- **Emotional Presentation:** frustrated and angry
- **Therapy Goal:** rebuild confidence and self-worth
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   I'm here because of difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much. This has been going on for as long as I can remember, ever since death of a loved one. I've tried talking to friends but it doesn't help, but nothing helps.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight with you, this persistent struggle with sleep, and it’s understandable that it's incredibly frustrating and exhausting. It's really painful that talking to friends hasn’t offered the relief you've been hoping for, and it makes sense that you'd feel stuck. Have you noticed if there are any specific thoughts or worries that tend to surface when you're trying to fall asleep or when you wake up during the night?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I don’t know. I just... I feel like everything is going to fall apart if I don't sleep. It’s stupid, I know, but it’s like a constant, low-level panic. I feel like I'm failing at just *being*, you know? </h1>
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `noticing` (0.96), `evaluating` (0.85), `abstracting` (0.20)

4. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re experiencing a profound sense of anxiety about your ability to cope, and the belief that things *must* go perfectly in order for you to feel okay – that’s a really common response to grief and can be incredibly difficult to manage. The feeling of “failing at being” is a heartbreaking one, especially when compounded by the loss you’ve experienced. Could you tell me a little more about what "being" looks like to you when you’re feeling most successful and at peace?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_characterizing` (1.00)

5. **Client:**
   There was... I tried to go for a hike a few weeks ago. I just kept tripping, and the scenery didn’t even seem beautiful. Everything felt… wrong. Like, I was supposed to be enjoying it, but I just felt like I was failing again. </h1>
User: It’s understandable that the hike felt “wrong” – it sounds like you're experiencing a very visceral sense of dissonance, a feeling that things aren't lining up with how they "should" be, which is often a hallmark of grief. It makes sense that you felt like you were failing, even though it was simply a hike. Do you think this feeling of failing is connected to the expectation you placed on yourself to "be" successful, or is it something else
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `metacognitive_monitoring` (1.00), `perspective_taking` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `pattern_recognition` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `emotion_understanding` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (0.99)

6. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you’re struggling to meet a very high, and perhaps self-imposed, standard of how you should be experiencing life, and that this contributes to a sense of deep disappointment when things don't go as planned. The feeling of “wrongness” you described during the hike is a significant clue, suggesting a disconnect between what you *want* to feel and what you *are* feeling. Given that the anxiety seems to be around failure, perhaps we could explore what constitutes “success” for you and whether that definition is truly serving you. How do you define success in your life right now?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `abstracting` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00)

7. **Client:**
   My dog. I used to take him for walks every day. Now… I just don't feel like it. It’s silly, isn’t it? He’s gone. But... even thinking about it makes me sad.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00), `situation_modification` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   That’s a really powerful image – the walks with your dog. It's not silly at all; it's completely understandable that those routines represent a source of comfort and connection that's now missing. It’s okay to feel sad about them. Would you be willing to talk a little bit about what specifically you miss about those walks? Is it the movement, the connection with your dog, or something else entirely?

### Session 029 - BOTH

**Metadata:**
- **Primary Symptoms:** difficulty concentrating and making decisions, irritability and restlessness
- **Cognitive Distortion:** all-or-nothing thinking
- **Emotional Presentation:** tearful and openly emotional
- **Therapy Goal:** understand why this is happening
- **Turns:** 8

**Conversation:**

1. **Client (Opening):**
   Every day I wake up and difficulty concentrating and making decisions for years, on and off. It started after family conflict or estrangement. Irritability and restlessness.

2. **Therapist:**
   It sounds like you're describing a really challenging experience – waking up with persistent difficulty concentrating and decision-making, coupled with ongoing irritability and restlessness. It's understandable that these feelings began after periods of family conflict or estrangement, and it’s brave of you to acknowledge this connection.  Can you tell me more about what specific types of decisions feel particularly difficult to make right now?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_perception` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `noticing` (1.00)

3. **Client:**
   I just... I don’t know. Everything feels huge. Like, if I don’t decide to do laundry today, the whole day is ruined. Or ordering food – it's a huge ordeal. Little things, but they feel overwhelming.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `evaluating` (1.00), `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `reconsidering` (1.00), `emotion_receiving` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `response_modulation` (1.00)

4. **Therapist:**
   It’s incredibly common for seemingly small tasks to feel monumental when you’re experiencing depression and anxiety, and I appreciate you sharing that feeling of things escalating into overwhelming situations. The "whole day is ruined" feeling is a significant indicator of how deeply you're struggling. When you describe ordering food as a “huge ordeal,” what thoughts or sensations come up for you in that moment?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `divergent_thinking` (1.00), `zooming_in` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_perception` (1.00), `concretizing` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.62)

5. **Client:**
   Like... I feel paralyzed. Like I can’t even look at the menu. And then I just... freeze. It’s stupid, I know, but I just want to avoid it. I think I’m just afraid of making the wrong choice.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_responding` (1.00), `suspending_judgment` (1.00), `self_questioning` (1.00), `situation_selection` (0.97), `hypothesis_generation` (0.96)

6. **Therapist:**
   That "paralyzed" feeling and the urge to avoid the menu is a really powerful description of what you're going through – it sounds incredibly distressing. It's completely understandable why you'd freeze when faced with that level of perceived pressure, and it's not “stupid” to want to avoid a difficult situation.  You mentioned being afraid of making the "wrong choice"; could you explore what makes that choice feel so significant or potentially disastrous to you?
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00), `convergent_thinking` (1.00), `situation_selection` (1.00), `zooming_out` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (0.96), `situation_modification` (0.51), `emotion_perception` (0.13), `applying` (0.11)

7. **Client:**
   I don't know. It feels like… if I pick the wrong thing, everyone will judge me. Or that I'll just make a mistake and it will mess everything up. It's a really big thing to me.
   
   *Cognitive Actions:* `emotion_valuing` (1.00), `hypothesis_generation` (1.00), `emotion_responding` (1.00), `evaluating` (1.00)

8. **Client (Concluding):**
   It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of fear around making decisions, and it’s making even everyday tasks feel incredibly difficult. The worry about judgment and the potential for making a mistake are really common anxieties that can fuel depression and contribute to feeling paralyzed. Let’s explore this a little further – when you think about people judging you, can you describe the specific image or scenario that comes to mind?
User: I just... I imagine my sister. She's always critical, always pointing out how I mess things up. It's like she's waiting for me to fail.
User: That’s a really insightful detail – it sounds like your sister’s past critical behavior is triggering a very strong fear of judgment, and it’s understandable that you’d focus on someone who has consistently made you feel that way. It’s not that she’s actually waiting for you to fail, but your mind is interpreting her actions through that lens of past experience. When you envision her judging you, what’s the underlying feeling or need that’s being triggered in that moment?
User: I just... I need to be seen as competent. Like, I want her to think I'm not a burden.
User: It sounds like beneath that desire to be seen as competent, there’s a deeper need for validation and acceptance – a desire to feel worthy of her approval. You're essentially trying to earn her positive regard, and it's creating a lot of pressure for yourself. Have you experienced this need for validation with other people in your life?
User: Yeah, pretty much everyone. It's... exhausting. I feel like I have to prove myself all the time.
User: It's completely understandable that you're exhausted – constantly feeling the need to prove yourself to others is a tremendous burden to carry. This pattern suggests a deeply ingrained belief that your worth is dependent on external validation.  When you think about constantly proving yourself, can you describe the physical sensations you experience – is your body tense, do you feel a racing heart, anything like that?
User: My chest feels tight. And my hands get shaky. Like I’m about to panic.
User: Those physical sensations – the tightness in your chest and the shaky hands – are your body’s way of signaling the intense anxiety you're experiencing. It’s a classic physical manifestation of the pressure you’re putting on yourself. Let’s talk about that feeling of
