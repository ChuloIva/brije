## üéØ How to Use

### For Local Training (Recommended)

```bash
# Basic usage (8 workers, optimized for 40GB)
./train_probe_pipeline_parallel.sh

# Maximum speed (12 workers)
./train_probe_pipeline_parallel.sh --num-workers 12 --batch-size 1024

# Conservative (4 workers)
./train_probe_pipeline_parallel.sh --num-workers 4 --batch-size 256

# Test single layer
./train_probe_pipeline_parallel.sh --layer 27 --num-workers 4
```

### For Google Colab

See `PARALLEL_TRAINING_COLAB_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on modifying your notebook.

**Quick version:**
1. Change `train_binary_probes.py` ‚Üí `train_binary_probes_parallel.py`
2. Add `--num-workers 8 --batch-size 512 --pin-activations-to-gpu`
3. Enjoy 8x speedup! üöÄ

## üîß Configuration Options

### Recommended Settings (40GB GPU)

```python
num_workers = 8              # Train 8 probes simultaneously
batch_size = 512             # Large batches for efficiency
pin_activations_to_gpu = True  # Pin to GPU memory
```

### Maximum Performance

```python
num_workers = 12             # Train 12 probes simultaneously
batch_size = 1024            # Very large batches
pin_activations_to_gpu = True
```

### Conservative/Stable

```python
num_workers = 4              # Train 4 probes simultaneously
batch_size = 256             # Moderate batch size
pin_activations_to_gpu = False
```

## üéì Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Thread-based parallelism**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` which works well with PyTorch's GIL-releasing operations
2. **GPU memory management**: All workers share the same GPU, training different probes simultaneously
3. **Batch processing**: Large batch sizes ensure GPU is fully utilized
4. **Memory pinning**: Optional pinning of activations to GPU memory for faster data transfer
5. **Thread-safe progress**: Uses locks to ensure progress updates don't interfere

### Why Threads Instead of Processes?

- PyTorch releases the GIL during CUDA operations
- Threads can share GPU memory efficiently
- No serialization overhead
- Better for GPU-bound workloads

### Memory Usage

- **Base model**: Already loaded once
- **Activations**: Loaded once, shared by all workers (if pinned)
- **Per-probe overhead**: ~2-5 MB per probe (tiny!)
- **Batch data**: ~50-100 MB per worker
- **Total estimate**: ~5-8 GB for 8 workers (plenty of room on 40GB GPU)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory?
```bash
# Reduce workers and batch size
--num-workers 4 --batch-size 256 --no-pin-activations
```

### Training Too Slow?
```bash
# Increase workers and batch size
--num-workers 12 --batch-size 1024
```

### Want to Verify GPU Usage?
```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```
You should see **70-90% GPU utilization** with parallel training.

## üìÅ Output Files

The parallel training creates the same output structure as sequential:

```
data/probes_binary/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ probe_reconsidering.pth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ probe_analyzing.pth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (45 probe files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aggregate_metrics.json      # Now includes speedup info!
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics_*.json              # Per-action metrics
```

### New Metrics in aggregate_metrics.json:
```json
{
  "average_auc_roc": 0.9234,
  "average_f1": 0.8765,
  "total_training_time_seconds": 510.5,
  "num_workers": 8,
  "per_action_metrics": [...]
}
```
